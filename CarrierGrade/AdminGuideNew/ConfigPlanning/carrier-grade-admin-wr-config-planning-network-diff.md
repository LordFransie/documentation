<!-- From the Titanium Server Admin Guide -->

Security groups are tenant-specific sets of IP filter rules that are applied to the networking stack of a virtual machine.

<hr>
**Note:** This feature applies only to servers in the VNF Region.
<hr>

The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade does not enforce a default security group when launching a new virtual
machine. Instead, the security groups are optional, and only enforced when explicitly assigned to a virtual machine,
either at launch time, or while it is executing.
At launch time, select the desired security groups from the tab Access & Security on the Launch Instance window.

For more information, see [Managing Security Groups](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/security/groups/).
