# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade (Beta): Working with Cluster Systems
<!-- From the Titanium Server Admin Guide -->

The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade cluster is represented internally by a unique object referred to as the system.

<hr>
**Note:** This feature applies only to servers in the VNF Region.
<hr>

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Horizon Dashboard](/helion/openstack/carrier/dashboard/login/).

2. Clicking **Inventory** on the **System Panel** section of the **Admin** menu, and then selecting the **Systems** tab. 

Information about this object is available from the Systems tab on the System Inventory page, as illustrated below.

By default, the name of the system object is its internal UUID, and it has no description. This can be changed from the **Edit Host** window, accessible by clicking **Edit System**.

After committing the changes, the Systems tab is displayed with the updated information.

The new name displays on the top left corner of the web management interface, and on the welcome message when logging in to the nodes using an SSH client.
