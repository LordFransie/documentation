# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade (Beta): Viewing Host Port Details
<!-- From the Titanium Server Admin Guide -->

The tab Ports on the Inventory Detail page presents information about the physical ports on a host, as illustrated below.

<hr>
**Note:** This feature applies only to servers in the VNF Region.
<hr>

Currently none of the port attributes is configurable; they are all read directly from the hardware. 

To view the host ports:

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Horizon Dashboard](/helion/openstack/carrier/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the **Admin** dashboard, then the **System** panel, then the **System Inventory** link.

3. Click the **Hosts** tab.

4. In the Host Name column, click the name of the locked host to open the **Inventory Detail** page for that host.

5. Click the **Ports** tab.

Port information is presented in several columns, as follows:

* Name - The name of the physical port, as identified by the host's Linux kernel.
* MAC Address - The port's unique MAC address.
* PCI Address - The port's unique address on the PCI bus. Together with the MAC address, this field can be used to uniquely identify a port on the host's hardware platform.
* Processor - The processor node that the port's IO controller is connected to.
* Auto Negotiation - The status of the Ethernet auto-negotiation flag. Currently, auto-negotiation is always enabled.
* Boot Interface - The boot flag, whether or not PXE booting is enabled.
* Device Type - Hardware information about the port type, manufacturer, and model.
