# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade (Beta): Setting Up the Scenario Environment

The deployment scenarios require an HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade environment established by the admin user, and set up by end users user1 and user2.

**Note:** This feature applies only to servers in the VNF Region.

The admin user must define user accounts, shared and external tenant networks, and VM flavors for the end users. The end users user1 and user2 can set up the remaining required resources, including keypairs, private tenant networks, virtual routers, Cinder volumes, Glance images, and virtual machine instances.

For an overview of the components that make up the scenario environment, see [Components of the Scenario Environment](/helion/openstack/carrier/deploy/setting/components/).

**Note:** You can set up the scenario environment using the web administration interface or the CLI. For CLI instructions, see [Deployment Scenarios Using the CLI](/helion/openstack/carrier/deploy/cli/).


1. Use the admin account to complete the following tasks, grouped as [Administrative Tasks](/helion/openstack/carrier/deploy/setting/admin/).

	* Create tenants
	* Create users
	* Set up segmentation ranges on existing provider networks
	* Set up tenant networks
	* Set up flavors 

2. Use the `user1` and `user2` accounts to complete the following tasks on `tenant1`, grouped as [User Tasks](/helion/openstack/carrier/deploy/setting/user/).

	* Create a keypair
	* Create a private tenant network
	* Configure the management network
	* Set up a virtual router
	* Set up a Cinder volume
	* Set up a Glance image

When these tasks have been completed, the environment is ready for scenario deployment.
