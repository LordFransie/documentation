        <p>This document describes the installation process for HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade in a baremetal environment.</p> 
        <section><title>About the installation</title> 

        <p>The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Alpha installation will create a base HP Helion OpenStack cloud that uses the [HP Networking (Neutron) service](/helion/openstack/carrier/services/networking/overview/) using Open vSwitch (OVS).</p> 

        <p>The HP Helion OpenStack cloud will consist of three controller systems and two [compute](/helion/openstack/carrier/services/compute/overview/) nodes. The installation also creates a KVM node virtual machine from which you can deploy [Volume Operation (Cinder) block storage](/helion/openstack/carrier/services/volume/overview/). See the Technical Overview and Support Matrix for more information.</p>

        <p>After installation, you can interact with the HP Helion OpenStack cloud using the [Horizon graphical interface](/helion/openstack/carrier/services/horizon/overview/) or using the APIs of the respective [services](/helion/openstack/carrier/services/overview/).</p> 
        </section>
        <section><title>Installation process</title>

        <p>Use the following process to install HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade in a baremetal environment.</p> 

        <p>Cloud Deployment will occur in following 3 phases:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Preparing HLM node</li>

            <li>Initializing network interfaces for all cloud nodes</li>

            <li>Finally deploying b2b cloud along with dcn components</li>
        </ol>
<p>In BM env you will have one KVM host given by customer to host your HLM VM. We will call this "hlm_kvm_host" in our ansible's hosts file</p>

<p>Customer will also provide DNS server and NTP server.</p>

<p>Customer will provide other cloud nodes along with additional nodes for DCN scenario - DCN host (KVM host that will host VSC and VSD VMs) and VRG node (server that will be VRS-G node)</p>
