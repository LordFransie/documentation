# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade Wind River Linux Overview

<!-- Taken from http://www.windriver.com/products/titanium-server/ -->

Wind River Linux is a high-performance, high-availability,
cloud operating system that enables telecommunications operators to use Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware to manage Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) within a carrier grade Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture.

Wind River Linux includes the critical run-time components and lifecycle development tools, services, and developer support needed to successfully build and deploy a virtualized network running multiple VMs.

* TL 9000 design methodology to guarantee six nines reliability
* Full 10 G line rate accelerated virtual switching running unmodified guest applications
* 10 µs deterministic interrupt latency to support virtualization in the most stringent customer-provided equipment (CPE) and access sections of the network
* Accelerated live VM migration, including the “share nothing” model—40% faster than enterprise software
* 500 km geographical redundancy over a standard IP network; more over dedicated fiber
* Detection of failed controllers, hosts, or VMs 60x faster than enterprise Linux; automatic recovery, with no single point of failure
* Fully integrated telecom-grade security, including complete AAA access control
* Involvement in trials with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and other standards bodies
