<p>HP Helion OpenStack(R) Carrier Grade integrates Wind River Linux with HP Helion OpenStack(R) to enable carrier grade network functions virtualization (NFV) capabilities.</p>
<p>HP Helion OpenStack(R) Carrier Grade is based on <xref href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.index.dita" >HP Helion Openstack 1.1</xref> but with significantly enhanced and optimized functionality, availability, scale and  performance to meet the needs of NFV cloud deployments.</p>
<p>HP Helion OpenStack(R) Carrier Grade uses multi-core HP Proliant rack-mounted servers with storage and networking along with the <xref href="http://www.windriver.com/products/titanium-server/" scope="external" format="html" >Wind River Titanium Server</xref>, <xref href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/networking-switches/product-detail.html?oid=7268885" scope="external" format="html" >HP Distributed Cloud Networking</xref>, Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), and virtual switch software for reliable and accelerated data plane.</p>
<p>HP will contribute enhancements and optimizations made to HP Helion OpenStack(R) Carrier Grade for NFV to upstream Openstack.</p>
<p>HP Helion OpenStack(R) Carrier Grade is sold, and supported as a separate software entity from HP Helion Openstack.</p>
