# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Logging into the Dashboard</h1>

1. Ask the cloud operator for the host name or public IP address from which you can access the dashboard, and for your user name and password.

2. Open a web browser that has JavaScript and cookies enabled.

3. In the address bar, enter the host name or IP address for the dashboard.</p>

	**Note:** If a certificate warning appears when you try to access the URL for the first time, a self-signed certificate is in use, which is not considered trustworthy by default. Verify the certificate or add an exception in the browser to bypass the warning.

4. On the Log In page, enter your user name and password, and click <strong>Sign In</strong>.

5. If you are a non-admin user, select a project from the list at the top of the screen.
