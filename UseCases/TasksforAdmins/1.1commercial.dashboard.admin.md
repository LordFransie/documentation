# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1 Using as an Admin User

The Admin dashboard enables you to work within the current cloud domain. You can access tools to work with the Compute, Network, Object Operations, and Orchestration services.

As an administrator (admin), you can perform all of the [user tasks](/helion/commercial/1.1/dashboard/managing/nonadmin/) in addition to the admin tasks.

### Managing Domains ###

You can manage:

* flavors</li>
* images</li>
* quotas</li>
* host aggregates</li>
* services</li>
