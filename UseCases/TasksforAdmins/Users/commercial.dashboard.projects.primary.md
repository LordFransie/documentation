# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Specifying a Primary Project for a User

When you create a user account, you must assign the account to a <em>primary</em> project. The primary project is simply the first project the user is associated with and must exist prior to creating the user.

Optionally, you can assign the account to additional projects. Before you can delete a user account, you must remove the user account from its primary project.

As an admin, you can specify a <em>primary</em> project for each user. 

### Specify a primary project ###

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the Users link on the Admin dashboard Identity panel.

3. For the user you want to modify, click the Edit button.

4. In the Update User screen, select a project from the Primary Project list.

5. Click Update User.
