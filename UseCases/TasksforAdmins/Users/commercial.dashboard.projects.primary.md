# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Specifying a Primary Project for a User

When you create a user account, you must assign the account to a <em>primary</em> project. The primary project is simply the first project the user is associated with and must exist prior to creating the user.</p>

Optionally, you can assign the account to additional projects. Before you can delete a user account, you must remove the user account from its primary project.</p>

As an admin, you can specify a <em>primary</em> project for each user. </p>

### Specify a primary project ###

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the <strong>Users</strong> link on the <strong>Admin</strong> dashboard <strong>Identity</strong> panel.</p>

3. For the user you want to modify, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</p>

4. In the <strong>Update User</strong> screen, select a project from the Primary Project list.</p>

5. Click <strong>Update User</strong>.</p>
