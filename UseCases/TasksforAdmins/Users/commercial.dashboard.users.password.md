2. Click the Users link on the Admin dashboard Identity panel.

3. In the Users screen, for the user you want to modify, click Edit.

4. In the Update User screen, enter a new password in the Password field and re-enter the password in the Confirm Password field to confirm.

5. Click Update User.

You must relay the new password information to the user in a secure manner under the rules of your organization.
