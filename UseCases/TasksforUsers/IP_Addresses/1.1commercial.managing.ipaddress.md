# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1 Managing Floating IP Addresses

Floating IP addresses allow external access to the instances in your network. 

You can use the dashboards to create a floating IP address pool that contains IP addresses you can associate to the instances on a network.

### Managing your floating IP addresses as a user

As a user, you can:

* [Associate a floating IP address with an instance](/helion/commercial/1.1/dashboard/managing/ipaddresses/associate/)
* [Allocate (create) new floating IP addresses](/helion/commercial/1.1/dashboard/managing/ipaddresses/associate/)

### Managing your floating IP addresses as an admin ###

As an admin user, you can work on all of the images in your domain, regardless of which project the group is associated with.

Access the **Instances** link on the **Project** dashboard **Compute** panel to work with floating IP addresses.

There are no additional tasks available to the admin user.
