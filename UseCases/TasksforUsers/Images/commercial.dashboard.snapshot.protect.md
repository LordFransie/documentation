# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Protecting Images

A virtual machine image is a single file that contains a virtual disk with a bootable operating system installed on it. You can use images to create virtual machine instances within the cloud. </p>

If you want to prevent an image from being deleted, you can make that image <em>protected</em>. </p>

### Protect an image ###

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the <strong>Images</strong> link on the <strong>Project</strong> dashboard <strong>Compute</strong> panel.</p>

3. In the <strong>Images</strong> screen, for the image you want to protect, click <strong>More &gt; Edit</strong>.</p>

4. In the <strong>Update Image</strong> screen, select <strong>Protected</strong>.</p>

5. Click <strong>Update Image</strong>.</p>

The image is protected and the <strong>Delete Image</strong> command is removed from the <strong>More</strong> menu.</p>
