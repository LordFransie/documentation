# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1 Creating an Instance Snapshot

A snapshot is a new image based on a running instance. That snapshot can be used as the base for new instances. 

### Creating a snapshot ###

To create a snapshot:

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/1.1/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the **Instances** link on the **Project** dashboard **Compute** panel.

3. In the **Instances** screen, for the instance you want to create a snapshot, click **Create Snapshot**.

4. On the **Create Snapshot** tab, enter a name for the snapshot.

5. Click **Launch** to launch the instance.

	A snapshot image is created on the **Images** link.

When you create a snapshot, by default the snapshot image can be used only with the current project and it can be deleted.

You can [make the snapshot public](/helion/commercial/1.1/dashboard/managing/images/public/) for use in all projects in the domain and you can [protect the image](/helion/commercial/1.1/dashboard/managing/images/protect/) from being deleted.
