# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Managing Instances

You can use the dashboards to manage instances created by other users. 

Use the **Compute** panel on the **Project** dashboard to:

* [Create a new instance](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/instances/create/)
* [Terminate an instance](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/instances/terminate/)
* [Reboot an instance](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/instances/reboot/)
* [Rebuild an instance](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/instances/rebuild/)
* [Suspend and resume an instance](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/instances/suspend/)
* [Pause and resume an instance](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/instances/pause/)
* [Create an instance snapshot](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/images/public/)

You can also [associate, or assign, a floating IP address](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/ipaddresses/) to an instance. A floating IP address makes the instance available on the external network.
