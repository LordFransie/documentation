# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Creating a Shared Network

A shared network is visible to all projects in the domain. Instances have a single NIC, and receive a fixed IP address from the subnet(s) associated with that network. 

An admin user can create a shared network as needed. 

### Create a network

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/1.1/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the **Networks** link on the **Admin** dashboard **Network** panel.

	The network(s) for the selected project appear. 

3. Click **Create Network**.

4. On the **Create Network** screen:

	* Enter a name for the network.
	* Select a project to associate with the network.
	* Leave **Admin State** selected to launch the network in the enabled state or clear the field to disable the new network.
	* Select **Shared** to make the network available to all projects in the domain.
	* Leave **External Network** clear to make the network internally accessible only.

5. Click **Create Network**.
