# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Viewing Your Network

The **Network Topology** screen is a physical representation of your network configuration.

Your network looks similar to the following diagram. 

[Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/dashboard/login/) and select the **Network Topology** link on the **Project** dashboard **Network** panel.

A router (here, labeled *Router 1*) is attached to the external network (labeled *Ext-Net*) so the internal network (labeled *Network1*) can be reached from the Internet. A *Network1* is attached to the router.
