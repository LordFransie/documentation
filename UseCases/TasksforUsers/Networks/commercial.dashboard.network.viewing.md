# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Viewing Your Network

The <strong>Network Topology</strong> screen is a physical representation of your network configuration.</p>

Your network looks similar to the following diagram. 

[Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/dashboard/login/) and select the <strong>Network Topology</strong> link on the <strong>Project</strong> dashboard <strong>Network</strong> panel.</p>

A router (here, labeled <em>Router 1</em>) is attached to the external network (labeled <em>Ext-Net</em>) so the internal network (labeled <em>Network1</em>) can be reached from the Internet. A <em>Network1</em> is attached to the router.</p>
