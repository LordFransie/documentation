# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Managing Networks

A network is a pluggable, scalable and API-driven system for managing networks and IP addresses.</p>

You can use the dashboards to create, delete, and configure your HP Helion OpenStack Community network and subnet(s). You can also manage the ports in your network.</p>

How you interact with your network environment depends upon your user type, either an administrative user (admin) or a non-administrative user (user). </p>

<strong>Note:</strong> The admin can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.</p>

## Managing your network as a user ##

As a user, you can work with the network(s) in the active project.</p>

Access the networking commands using the <strong>Networks</strong> panel on the <strong>Project</strong> dashboard. </p>

The <strong>Network</strong> panel contains commands to view a visual representation of your network and to enable you to work with your network.</p>

* <a href="/helion/community/network/viewing/">View your network</a></li>
* <a href="/helion/community/network/create/">Create or delete a network</a></li>
* <a href="/helion/community/network/enable/">Enable or disable a network</a></li>

## Managing your network as an admin ##

As an admin user, you can work on all of the network(s) in your domain, regardless of which project the network is associated with.</p>

In addition to all of the user tasks, you can also make a network a shared network and make a network accessible externally. </p>

Access the networking commands using the <strong>System</strong> panel on the <strong>Admin</strong> dashboard. </p>

* <a href="/helion/commercial/dashboard/manage/network/external/create/">Creating externally available networks</a> </li>
* <a href="/helion/community/dashboard/manage/network/subnet/">Add or remove a subnet to/from a Network</a></li>
* <a href="/helion/community/dashboard/manage/network/ports/">Create, Modify, or Delete a port on a Network</a></li>
