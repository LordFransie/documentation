# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Creating and Deleting Containers

A container is a storage compartment for your data and provides a way for you to organize your data. You can think of a container as a folder in Windows&reg; or a directory in UNIX&reg;. The primary difference between a container and these other file system concepts is that containers cannot be nested. You can, however, create an unlimited number of containers within your account. Data must be stored in a container so you must have at least one container defined in your account prior to uploading data.</p>

### Create a container ###

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the <strong>Object Store</strong> tab on the dashboard <strong>Project</strong> panel.</p>

3. In the <strong>Object Store</strong> panel, click <strong>Containers</strong>.</p>

4. In the <strong>Create Container</strong> dialog box, enter a name for the container, set the access level and then click <strong>Create Container</strong>.</p>

	**Note:** A Public Container will allow anyone with the Public URL to gain access to your objects in the container.</p>

### Delete a container ###

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the <strong>Object Store</strong> tab on the dashboard <strong>Project</strong> panel.</p>

4. From the <strong>More</strong> drop-down list next to a container, select <strong>Delete container</strong></p>
