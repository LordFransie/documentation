# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Managing Routers

Each network can be assigned a router, which provides a gateway to external networks.

You can use the dashboards to create, delete, and configure your HP Helion OpenStack network and subnet(s). You can also manage the ports in your network.

How you interact with your network environment depends upon your user type, either an administrative user (admin) or a non-administrative user (user). 

**Note:** The admin can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.

## Managing your router as a user ##

As a user, you can work with the router in the active project.

Access the router commands using the Networks panel on the Project dashboard. 

The Network panel contains commands to view a visual representation of your network and to enable you to work with your router.

* [Create a Router](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/router/create/)
* [Delete a Router](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/router/delete/)
* [Connect a network to a router](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/router/connect/)
* Add / Remove an external network to/from a Router</li>
</ul>

## Managing your router as an admin ##

As an admin user, you can work on all of the network(s) in your domain, regardless of which project the network is associated with.

An admin can create a shared network, which can be seen in every project in the domain. You can also create an external network.

* [Create a shared network](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/network/shared/)
* [Create an external network](/helion/commercial/dashboard/managing/network/external/)

Access the router commands using the System panel on the Admin dashboard.
