You can manage access to projects by assigning users and setting primary projects. You can also control resources by managing operational quotas.</p>

### Creating projects

As an admin, you can use create projects and allow specific users to access each project:</p>

* <a href="/helion/community/projects/creating/">Create and delete projects</a></li>
* <a href="/helion/community/projects/viewing/">View details on a project</a></li>
* <a href="/helion/community/projects/users/">Add and remove users to a project</a></li>

### Managing quotas 

Quotas are operational limits that you can configure to prevent system capacities from being exhausted without notification. </p>

Use the <strong>Identity</strong> panel on the <strong>Admin</strong> dashboard to set maximum limits for metadata, instances, CPUs, memory, and other settings for each project.</p>

* <a href="/helion/community/quotas/managing/">Modify the quota of a project</a></li>
