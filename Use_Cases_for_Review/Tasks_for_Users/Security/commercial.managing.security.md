# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Managing Security

HP Helion OpenStack Community uses security groups and security rules to control access to instances in your cloud.</p>

You can use the dashboards to create, delete and configure security groups and security group rules to control access to your instance</p>

How you interact with your network environment depends upon your user type, either an administrative user (admin) or a non-administrative user (user). </p>

**Note:** The admin can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.</p>

## Managing security as a user ##

As a user, you can work with the security groups and rules in the active project.</p>

Access the security commands using the Compute panel on the Project dashboard. </p>

Click Access &amp; Security to work with security groups and rules to perform the following tasks:</p>

* <a href="/helion/community/security/groups/">Create a security group</a></li>
* <a href="/helion/community/security/groups/">Create security group rules</a></li>
* <a href="/helion/community/security/keypairs/">Managing Key Pairs</a></li>

## Managing security as an admin ##

As an admin user, you can work on all of the security groups in your domain, regardless of which project the group is associated with. </p>
