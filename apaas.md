# HP Cloud application platform as a service (aPaaS) overview

The HP Cloud application platform as a service (aPaaS) is an application platform for development, deployment, and management of cloud applications using any language on any stack. HP Cloud aPaaS allows you to develop, deploy, and scale applications in the cloud while ensuring security.
