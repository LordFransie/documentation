There are a number of HP Cloud APIs available for your programming pleasure: 

* [Identity service](/api/v13/identity/): API for the HP Cloud identity service; one-stop authentication for all HP Cloud service offerings.

* [Image](/api/v13/image/): API for HP Cloud Image; enabling managing of virtual machine images.
* [Block Storage](/api/v13/block-storage/): API for HP Cloud block storage; enabling additional volumes to Compute instances.
