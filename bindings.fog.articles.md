#Ruby Fog bindings for HP Cloud: Articles on how to use our Ruby Fog bindings#

##Important Notice##

Over the past two years, we have been a leading contributor of the Ruby Fog binding and have contributed to features that span Folsom to Havana. On November 4, 2013, the HP Public Cloud extensions for Ruby Fog Bindings became a part of the standard Fog download available from the main [Fog repository](https://github.com/fog/fog).  This 'hpfog' gem contribution means you no longer need a special download to work with our cloud. We are working on transitioning all of our current documentation to the Ruby Fog community to be directly available in the Fog GitHub repository.
 
The Ruby Fog community has 100s of [active contributors](https://github.com/fog/fog/graphs/contributors) and we are looking forward to the further enhancements and features that are generated from this healthy community; a community that encourages collaboration and support.
 
Read our [blog post](http://www.hpcloud.com/blog/releasing-ruby-bindings-wild) to learn more about our work with Ruby Fog.

In addition to the pages of examples we have for the compute, object storage, and other HP Cloud services, we wanted to give you a few additional tips and How-tos to make using your Ruby Fog bindings even easier. Take a look at one of the "How to" articles listed below to find out more!
