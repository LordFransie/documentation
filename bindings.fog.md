# HP Cloud Extensions to Ruby Fog Binding

##Important Notice##

Over the past two years, we have been a leading contributor of the Ruby Fog binding and have contributed to features that span Folsom to Havana. On November 4, 2013, the HP Public Cloud extensions for Ruby Fog Bindings became a part of the standard Fog download available from the main [Fog repository](https://github.com/fog/fog).  This 'hpfog' gem contribution means you no longer need a special download to work with our cloud. We are working on transitioning all of our current documentation to the Ruby Fog community to be directly available in the Fog GitHub repository.
 
The Ruby Fog community has 100s of [active contributors](https://github.com/fog/fog/graphs/contributors) and we are looking forward to the further enhancements and features that are generated from this healthy community; a community that encourages collaboration and support.
 
Read our [blog post](http://www.hpcloud.com/blog/releasing-ruby-bindings-wild) to learn more about our work with Ruby Fog.

_______________

By using the HP Cloud Ruby library, developers can write applications using Ruby that interacts with the HP Public Cloud without having to deal with the underlying REST API or XML document formats.

This library is an extension of [Fog](http://github.com/fog/fog), a Ruby open-source multi-cloud computing library. 

##Version 12.12 Extensions to Ruby Fog Binding

The HP Cloud Ruby library currently supports HP Cloud Compute, HP Cloud Object Storage, HP Cloud CDN, and HP Cloud Block Storage. Support for other services will be added as they become available.

* [Installation Instructions](/bindings/fog/install)

##Version 13.5 Extensions to Ruby Fog Binding

##Reference Materials

For our release-by-release information, take a look at [our release notes](/bindings/fog/release-notes)!  And if you want to look at the main Fog reference documents, surf on over to the [Documentation for fog/fog (master) Alphabetic Index](http://rubydoc.info/github/fog/fog/frames/index); the ReadMe file might be a good place for you to start.

To install and use HP Cloud Ruby bindings for Fog, please install the [latest release](http://fog.io/) of Fog.
