./glossary.md::    A coding layer that provides programming language-specific access to the underlying core code base REST API HTTP calls.  For example, instead of including a call to the REST API by using HTTP **verb** (GET), path (/flavors), format (?format=json)</font>, and the other HTTP attributes, using the request layer you can simplify the call to `list_flavors()` (the specific call depends on the details of your specific request layer syntax).  The request layer handles all HTTP request and response parsing and exception handling.  Also **request layer**.
