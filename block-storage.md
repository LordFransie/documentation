# HP Cloud Block Storage Overview

Need more storage for your HP Cloud Compute instances?  HP Block Storage is the way to go. With HP Cloud version 13.5 block storage is provided as a separate but integrated service based on OpenStack Cinder.

Once created, you can easily disconnect Block Storage volumes from one instance and attach them to another.  You can also create Snapshots to easily copy a volume before making significant changes to it.  Custom volumes ranging in sizes from 1 GB to 2 TB can be created using a variety of file system types.
