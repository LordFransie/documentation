#Work with HP Helion Public Cloud using the 13.5 CLI#

You can interact with HP Helion Public Cloud using the native Openstack Command-Line Interface (CLI) tools.
 
HP Helion Public Cloud is based on Openstack, and the latest Openstack CLIs and libraries are compatible with our HP Helion Public Cloud version 13.5. We recommend using a recent version of each of the CLI tools, which you can install using pip/pypi using our instructions linked below.
 
For those of you using HP Helion Public Cloud version 12.12, you need to download the HP Helion Public Cloud Python Novaclient that is an extension to the Openstack Python Novaclient enabling interaction with HP Helion Public Cloud compute and block storage.
