# UNIX CLI for HP Helion Public Cloud v13.5 Compute Examples

If you are using v12.12, click [here](https://docs.hpcloud.com/cli/unix/compute) for documentation.
___________________

###Important Notice###

On November 4, 2013, the UNIX CLI was moved into its End-of-Life (EOL) Cycle process toward final deprecation. Please be aware that this does not mean that the UNIX CLI is "going away", but simply that HP Helion Public Cloud is relinquishing its ownership of this CLI and, instead, making it available on the [HPCloud Github](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli) repository. We encourage existing customers to consider migrating to the OpenStackClient (Unified) CLIs. As such, during this 6-month transition timeframe, HP Helion Public Cloud will be dedicating engineering efforts around the OpenStackClient CLI as the primary Unified CLI of choice for development around your OpenStack cloud services.

We wanted to ensure you were aware of the changes that may affect you during this 6-month transition time:

+ The UNIX CLI has moved to the HP Helion Public Cloud Github repository

  + In order to encourage development by the community, HP Helion Public Cloud is sharing it with the community as open source, hosted on [https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli).
 
  + However, [links to 12.12 and 13.5 UNIX CLI downloads](#downloads), and all documentation, are still currently available on docs.hpcloud.com, as usual.

+ Bugs will be addressed

  + Although the CLI has moved into the open source community, showstoppers and significant defects will be examined and addressed by the HP Helion Public Cloud SDK/CLI team on a case-by-case basis.

HP Helion Public Cloud has contributed the Unix CLI back to the open source community, and you can get support, access the documentation, and download the source code [here](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli).

##Server Commands## {#ServerCommands}

Newer versions of the CLI track private keys and the keys associated with servers so you can access those servers without manually specifying the key files.  Use the `[keypairs:private](/cli/unix/2/reference#keypairs/)` commands to manage these private keys.

To list servers, run:

    $ hpcloud servers

To list one or more servers (you can specify the servers by name or ID), run:

    $ hpcloud servers mongo 1083654

To add a new server specifying an image and a flavor, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:add myserver 100 -i 227
    Created server 'myserver' with id 'a376d55d'.

If `preferred_flavor` and `preferred_image` are defined in your account file, you do not need to specify them on the command line. Run the command as follows:

    $ hpcloud servers:add sameold
    Created server 'sameold' with id 'b0245877'.

To add a new server (specifying a flavor, an image, a keyname and a security group), run:

    $ hpcloud servers:add myserver 100 -i 227 -k mykey -s mysecgroup
    Created server 'myserver' with id '9d678495'.

To add a new persistent server (specifying a flavor, a bootable volume, a keyname and a security group), run:

    $ hpcloud servers:add bat large -i 5575 -v bootable -k brat
    Created server 'bat' with id '2f574231'.

Information at the following link provides information about creating and [Accessing Servers with Managed Key Pairs](/cli/unix/articles/managedkeypairs).

To display the console of a server, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:console cli_test_srv1
    Console output for cli_test_srv1:
    * Starting regular background program processing daemon                 [ OK ]
    * Starting deferred execution scheduler                                 [ OK ]
    ...

To display the password of a windows server, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:console winserv4 -d

To log in to a server using the secure shell, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:ssh cli_test_srv1
    Connecting to 'cli_test_srv1'...
    Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-virtual x86_64)
    ...
    ubuntu@cli-test-srv1:~$

To change the password of an existing server, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:password myserver new_password
    Password changed for server 'myserver'.

To perform a soft or hard reboot of an existing server, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:reboot myserver
    Soft rebooting server 'myserver'.

    $ hpcloud servers:reboot myserver --hard
    Hard rebooting server 'myserver'.

To rebuild an existing server, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:rebuild myserver
    Server 'myserver' being rebuilt.

To add or update the metadata of an existing server (the metadata must be a comma-separated list of key value pairs), run:

    $ hpcloud servers:metadata:add myserver 'pv=nRT,e=mc2'
    Server 'myserver' set metadata 'pv=nRT,e=mc2'.

To update the metadata to an existing server (the metadata must be a comma-separated list of key value pairs), run:

    $ hpcloud servers:metadata:update myserver 'pv=presentValue,e=eulers'
    Server 'myserver' set metadata 'pv=presentValue,e=eulers'.

To list the metadata for an existing server, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:metadata myserver
       +-----+-------+
       | key | value |
       +-----+-------+
       | pv  | nRT   |
       | e   | mc2   |
       +-----+-------+

To remove metadata from an existing snapshot server, run:

    $ hpcloud servers:metadata:remove myserver pv
    Removed metadata 'pv' from server 'myserver'.

To remove an existing server or servers (you can specify one or more servers by name or ID), run:

    $ hpcloud servers:remove myserver c7e35261
    Removed server 'myserver'.
    Removed server 'c7e35261'.


###Creating a Windows Instance### {#WindowsServer}

To create a Windows compute instance, you need to specify:

* The file that contains the private segment of your key pair in PEM format
* A security group with port 3389 open (for RDP); see [security group rules](/cli/unix/2/compute#SecurityGroupRuleCommands) for information on opening a port on a security group.  

Windows servers are a little slower to start up than other servers, taking from only a few minutes up to fifteen minutes.

In the following example, `winserv` is the name of the server, `large` is the flavor name, `1000065672` is the Windows image identifier, `winpair` is the key pair name, `allowsRDP` is the security group with port 3389 open, and ` ./winpair.pem` is the .pem file location (in the current folder). Run:

    $ hpcloud servers:add winserv large -i 1000065672 -k winpair -s allowsRDP -p ./winpair.pem
    Created server 'winserver' with id '1db7ec91'.
    Retrieving password, this may take several minutes...
    Windows password: Hj67dgski)
    Make sure the security group has port 3389 open
    You may wish to change the password when you log in
    
**Note**: The output for this command is the Windows Administrator password. To connect to the instance via the public IP and RDP, use  `username` Administrator and the presented password for `password`.

<!-- Hiding until we can find this page
See [the How To page](/compute/using#WindowsRDP) for an example of how to connect via a Windows RDP client.  You can use the `servers:console` command to extract the password if it is still available on the console. -->
