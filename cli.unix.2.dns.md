# UNIX CLI DNS Examples
___________________

###Important Notice###

On November 4, 2013, the UNIX CLI was moved into its End-of-Life Cycle process toward final deprecation. During this 6-month transition time:

* New and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the OpenStackClient (Unified) CLIs or the OpenStack command-line clients for each respective service
* No new feature requests will be honored
* Bug reports will be accepted

After 6-months, access to online resources will still be available, but no support will be offered from HP Public Cloud, and the software download will be disabledâ€”although you are most welcome to continue development at your discretion! HP Cloud has contributed the Unix CLI back to the open source community, and you can access the source code, documentation, and downloads [here](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli).

This page discusses DNS and provides some examples of how to perform DNS tasks on HP Cloud.
