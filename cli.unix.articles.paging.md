#UNIX CLI: Modifying report paging#

___________________

###Important Notice###

On November 4, 2013, the UNIX CLI was moved into its End-of-Life Cycle process toward final deprecation. During this 6-month transition time:

* New and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the OpenStackClient (Unified) CLIs or the OpenStack command-line clients for each respective service
* No new feature requests will be honored
* Bug reports will be accepted

After 6-months, access to online resources will still be available, but no support will be offered from HP Public Cloud, and the software download will be disabledâ€”although you are most welcome to continue development at your discretion! HP Cloud has contributed the Unix CLI back to the open source community, and you can access the source code, documentation, and downloads [here](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli).

_________________________________________

You can use the two command-line interface (CLI) configuration settings `report_page_length` and `storage_page_length` to change the way your reports are generated:

* `report_page_length` sets the number of records that are printed for each page of a report (default is 60 records per page)
* `storage_page-length`sets the number of records for each read (default is 10,000 records)

You can change the values with the [`config:set`](/cli/unix/reference#config:set) command.  To change the number of records per page to 120:

    hpcloud config:set report_page_length=120

This report_page_length is only used for container and object lists.  In general, reports are typically less than 60 records.  Setting `report_page_length` to a large value causes the CLI to buffer more records before displaying them, which slows down report generation.

To change the number of records for a particular read to a value other than the default of 10,000:

    hpcloud config:set storage_page_length=5000

Setting `storage_page_open` to a very small value creates more read calls to the server, and slows down report generation. 

In general, we suggest you leave these values set to their defaults.
