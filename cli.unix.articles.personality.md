#UNIX CLI: Creating servers with custom Personality v12.12#

___________________

###Important Notice###

On November 4, 2013, the UNIX CLI was moved into its End-of-Life Cycle process toward final deprecation. During this 6-month transition time:

* New and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the OpenStackClient (Unified) CLIs or the OpenStack command-line clients for each respective service
* No new feature requests will be honored
* Bug reports will be accepted

HP Cloud has contributed the Unix CLI back to the open source community, and you can get support, access the documentation, and download the source code [here](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli).

_________________________________________

You can use the Unix command-line interface (CLI) to create custom pre-configured servers with the [`servers:add`](/cli/unix/reference#servers:add) personality option.  The argument to the `--personality` option is a directory that contains the files you want to add to the newly created server.  The files should be stored in the directory as if the directory was the root file system of the server.  For example if you had a directory:

    terry@brat:~$ find rootdir/ -type f
    rootdir/etc/apache2/sites-available/100www
    rootdir/home/ubuntu/.profile

Use the `--personality` option to pass in the personality directory:

    $ hpcloud servers:add userver large -k kwikset -i 75845 --personality rootdir
    Created server 'userver' with id '973965'.

The server will be created with the files in your personality directory.  In this example, the `/etc/apache2/sites-available/100www` and `/home/ubuntu/.profile` files will be created.

There are limits to the number and size of the files that can be used with.  Use the `hpcloud servers:limits` command to see the personality limits.
