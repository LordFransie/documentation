# Unix Command Line Interface

#HP Cloud UNIX CLI Release Notes

###Important Notice###

On November 4, 2013, the UNIX CLI was moved into its End-of-Life Cycle process toward final deprecation. During this 6-month transition time:

* New and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the [OpenStackClient (Unified) CLIs](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClient) or the [OpenStack command-line clients](http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/section_cli_overview.html) for each respective service
* No new feature requests will be honored
* Bug reports will be accepted

After 6-months, access to online resources will still be available, but no support will be offered from HP Public Cloud, and the software download will be disabled&mdash;although you are most welcome to continue development at your discretion.

_________________________________________

The Unix Command Line Interface is a tool which allows Unix or Mac users to manage their HP Public Cloud from the command line or automated through scripts.  There is no need to understand the underlying REST API or XML document format to use the Unix CLI.  There are two versions of the Unix CLI: the 2.0 version for Cloud 1.1 and the 1.9 version for Cloud 1.0.
