# Cloud OS Development with REST APIs

Welcome! These topics describe the Cloud OS REST APIs for the value-added services. 

## Introduction

HP Cloud OS features an interactive REST API environment: the HP Cloud OS API Documentation app. Learn the syntax and 
properties by reading the well-organized reference details. Submit each request using the provided forms and immediately 
view the server response. The app is installed on your deployed clouds. The documentation app's URLs per service are:

 * Eve service: &lt;my_server>:21051/eve/docs/index.html

 * Focus: http://&lt;my_server>:21061/docs/index.html

 * Graffiti: http://&lt;my_server>:21071/docs/index.html

On your cloud, replace &lt;my_server> with the server's IP or DNS value.

## Read the API Quick Start topic
