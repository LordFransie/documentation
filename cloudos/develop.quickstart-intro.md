## HP Cloud OS API Introduction

Welcome to the HP Cloud OS 1.2.0 release. For developers, HP Cloud OS includes a REST API that allows you to interact programmatically with your clouds.  

This API Quick Start topic is designed to help you learn the API by introducing the HP Cloud OS services and walking through several use cases.  

On your deployed clouds, we have also provided the HP Cloud OS API Documentation app. It's a framework for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing the API. 
The app includes comprehensive reference API documentation and an interactive environment where you can try each request and view the response from your server. 
   
Also refer to the [OpenStack API documentation](http://docs.openstack.org).   

### Prerequisites

This topic assumes that you have already:

* Installed and set up HP Cloud OS, following the instructions in the HP Cloud OS Installation Guide. 

* Used the HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard to define the OS image and related components for your cloud.

* Launched an OS image on your cloud instance.* Created a project.

If you have not yet set up a cloud, refer to the HP Cloud OS Installation Guide for instructions.

Note: After a cloud environment has been created in the Operational Dashboard, you manage the cloud through the Administration Dashboard. The Administration Dashboard provides a simplified means of creating and managing Cloud Connector resources, infrastructure topology templates, resource             
binding documents, as well as the ability to provision a composite topology described by the             
topology templates and binding documents.
            
For details about the user interface dialogs, click Help from the top banner of the dashboards. Or see these web-hosted URLs:

* [HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard Help](/cloudos/operational-dashboard/) 

* [HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard Help](/cloudos/administration-dashboard)
         
To submit REST API calls, you will need your OpenStack Keystone authentication credentials so you can generate security tokens. 
The steps are described in the [API Security Tokens](#API-Security-Tokens) section of this topic.
   
As you walk through the examples in this topic and submit REST calls, you'll need to provide the actual values that pertain to your cloud. We'll 
identify the properties you must modify in the REST calls, including some that are generated by prior calls and shown in the POST responses.
        
In call payloads, we recommend that you set the scope to the default <code>user-project</code> level, 
to prevent unintended impacts on other projects.

### What is HP Cloud OS?

HP Cloud OS is an open and extensible architecture that leverages the power of OpenStack technology, 
the fastest growing open-source cloud computing platform community. HP Cloud OS is a technology platform 
that enables the products in the HP Converged Cloud portfolio to enhance workload portability, 
simplify installation and enhance lifecycle management across private, public and hybrid cloud environments. 
You can use the HP Cloud OS technology to help accelerate business outcomes. 

The HP Cloud OS technology platform includes enhanced features, providing immediate advantages for IT sysadmins and developers:

* A unified installer that packages together all the HP Cloud OS components along with the OpenStack components into a single ISO, saving you time and effort to get started.

* Additional topology services, which we'll introduce in this topic: Eve, Graffiti and Focus.

* Pre-configured, optimized 'flavors' to meet a variety of computing and storage scenarios and requirements.

* Three UIs to manage the operational, administrative, and advanced installation tasks that are inherent in cloud-based computing.

* HP Cloud OS API Documentation, an app featuring "Try it out!" request/response actions and embedded reference documentation.

* A common architecture for all HP Cloud technologies.

## What are the HP Cloud OS Services?

HP Cloud OS provides the following services:

* Eve - topology provisioning service

* Focus - topology document repository service

* Graffiti - resource pools registry service and disctionary service

Here's a summary about the HP Cloud OS services:

What is the HP Cloud OS API Documentation app?

The HP Cloud OS API Documentation app is a tool for describing, producing, and visualizing RESTful web services. 
The goal is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server. 
The documentation of methods, parameters, and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to stay in sync.

The app is defined in JSON files and is presented in a web interface. Here's an example of the app for the HP Cloud OS Focus service.

The app provides developers who are learning a new REST API quick and easy access to:

* Each call's URI syntax

* Whether there are any required or optional query parameters

* The data type of each parameter

* The model and its schema

* Interactive "Try it out!" dialogs that let you submit calls to your server, see the results, and figure out how you need to construct your REST URIs and any payloads.

For example, in the HP Cloud OS API Documentation app for Focus, having entered a known ID of a document, we can retrieve it from the 
repository with this <code> GET /1/document_list/1672048591 </code> call, using the "Try it out!" button:

After clicking "Try it out!", the app displays the response. In this case, the specified document was found:

The HP Cloud OS API Documentation includes other handy features, as you'll see when we walk through the use cases.

## API Documentation Ports per Service

Your HP Cloud OS instance comes installed with the HP Cloud OS API Documentation. Each service reserves a unique port number in the URL. Using a Chrome or Firefox browser, you can open the HP Cloud OS API Documentation as follows. Just replace "my_server" with the DNS hostname or IP address of your server:

* Eve: http://my_server:21051/eve/docs/index.html

* Focus: http://my_server:21061/docs/index.html

* Graffiti: http://my_server:21071/docs/index.html

## API Security Tokens

Before you can submit REST calls to your HP Cloud OS instance, or use the interactive features of the HP Cloud OS API Documentation app, 
you must generate a security token from Keystone, which is an OpenStack service. If you skip this step, or if you have an expired token, 
you will receive a 401 error message in the response. Example:

( image ) 

cloudos-unauthroized-example.png

### Getting the Security Token from the HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard

The easiest, "non-programmatic" way to get the security token is via the HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard. 
If you have Admin access, login and click Settings > Cloud API / CLI. The UI displays the current security token returned from Keystone. 
Example:

( image ) 

cloudos-admin-dashboard-settings-token.png  (need updated version)

Copy the token's value and proceed to the next section of this topic.

### Getting the Security Token via a REST Call

To generate a security token, use:

<pre>
&lt;keystone_server>:35357/v3.0/tokens
</pre> 

In the Header, specify:

<pre>
content-type = application/json
accept = application/json
</pre>

In the POST payload, use the following JSON to get a security token. The values shown here are just examples. 
You must provide your username, password, and tenantName. Based on the information provided, Keystone will verify the 
roles and, if valid, return the token.

<pre>
{
  "auth":{
    "passwordCredentials":{
    "username":"myusername",
    "password":"mysecretpassword"
    },
    "tenantName":"AdminProject"
  }
}
</pre>
