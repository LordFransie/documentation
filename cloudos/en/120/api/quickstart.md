# HP Cloud OS API Quick Start

* [HP Cloud OS API Introduction](#hp-cloud-os-api-introduction)
    * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
    * [What is HP Cloud OS?](#what-is-hp-cloud-os)
* [Upstream Documentation](#upstream-documentation)

## HP Cloud OS API Introduction

Welcome to the HP Cloud OS 1.2.0 release. For developers, HP Cloud OS includes a REST API that allows you to interact programmatically with your clouds.  

This API Quick Start topic is designed to help you learn the API by introducing the HP Cloud OS services and walking through several use cases.  

On your deployed clouds, we have also provided the HP Cloud OS API Documentation app. It's a framework for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing the API. 
The app includes comprehensive reference API documentation and an interactive environment where you can try each request and view the response from your server. 
   
Also refer to the [OpenStack API documentation](http://docs.openstack.org).   

### Prerequisites

This topic assumes that you have already:

* Installed and set up HP Cloud OS, following the instructions in the HP Cloud OS Installation Guide. 
* Used the HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard to define the OS image and related components for your cloud.
* Launched an OS image on your cloud instance.
* Created a project.

If you have not yet set up a cloud, refer to the HP Cloud OS Installation Guide for instructions.

Note: After a cloud environment has been created in the Operational Dashboard, you manage the cloud through the Administration Dashboard. The Administration Dashboard provides a simplified means of creating and managing Cloud Connector resources, infrastructure topology templates, resource             
binding documents, as well as the ability to provision a composite topology described by the             
topology templates and binding documents.
            
For details about the user interface dialogs, see the <i>HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard Guide</i> and 
the <i>HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard Guide</i>, which were provided on the FTP site for this 
release.
            
To submit REST API calls, you will need your OpenStack Keystone authentication credentials so you can generate security tokens. 
The steps are described in the [API Security Tokens](#API-Security-Tokens) section of this topic.
   
As you walk through the examples in this topic and submit REST calls, you'll need to provide the actual values that pertain to your cloud. We'll 
identify the properties you must modify in the REST calls, including some that are generated by prior calls and shown in the POST responses.
        
In call payloads, we recommend that you set the scope to the default <code>user-project</code> level, 
to prevent unintended impacts on other projects.

### What is HP Cloud OS?

HP Cloud OS is an open and extensible architecture that leverages the power of OpenStack technology, 
the fastest growing open-source cloud computing platform community. HP Cloud OS is a technology platform 
that enables the products in the HP Converged Cloud portfolio to enhance workload portability, 
simplify installation and enhance lifecycle management across private, public and hybrid cloud environments. 
You can use the HP Cloud OS technology to help accelerate business outcomes. 

The HP Cloud OS technology platform includes enhanced features, providing immediate advantages for IT sysadmins and developers:

* A unified installer that packages together all the HP Cloud OS components along with the OpenStack components into a single ISO, saving you time and effort to get started.
* Additional topology services, which we'll introduce in this topic: Eve, Graffiti and Focus.
* Pre-configured, optimized 'flavors' to meet a variety of computing and storage scenarios and requirements.
* Two UIs to manage the operational and administrative tasks that are inherent in cloud-based computing.
* HP Cloud OS API Documentation, an app featuring "Try it out!" request/response actions and embedded reference documentation.
* A common architecture for all HP Cloud technologies.
