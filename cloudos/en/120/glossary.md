## A

**API**
> An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. 
An API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together. 
Cloud OS provides a REST API so that programmers can write applications consistent with the operating environment.

## B

**broad network access**
> Broad network access means the capabilities are available over the network and are accessed through standard 
mechanisms that promote the use by heterogenous thin-client or thick-client platforms.  Examples: mobile phones, tablets, laptops 
and workstations.

## C

**cloud computing**
> Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources.  These resources include networks, servers, storage, applications and services. 
An advantage of cloud computing is that the resources can be provisioned or released rapidly, with minimal 
management effort or service provider interaction.

## H

**hybrid cloud**
> In a hybrid cloud, the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private or public) 
that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application 
portability, such as cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds.

## M

**measured service**
> Measured service means cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage by leveraging a metering capability.  
This metering may occur at some level of abstraction that's appropriate to the type of service, such as storage, processing 
power, bandwidth, and the number of active users.  Resource usage may be monitored, controlled, and reported.  Measured service 
provides transparency for the provider and the consumer of the utilized service.

## O

**on-demand self service**
> With on-demand self service, a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, 
as needed, automatically, without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

## P

**private cloud**
> In a private cloud, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers, 
such as business units.  The private cloud may be owned, managed and operated by the organization, a third party. or some combination, 
and it may exist on or off the owner's premises.

**public cloud**
> In a public cloud,the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public.  It may be owned, managed and operated 
by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination.  It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.

## R

**rapid elasticity**
> Rapid elasticity means capabilities can be provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward 
commensurate with demand.  To the consumer, these capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be 
appropriated in any quantity at any time.

**resource pooling**
> Resource pooling means the provider's computing resources are pooled to server multiple consumers using a 
multi-tenant model. Different physical and virtual resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer 
demand. A characteristic of resource pooling is location independence.  The customer does not need to know or manage or control 
the exact location of the provided resources, but may be able to specify it at a high-level of abstraction, such as a resource's 
country, state, or data center.  Examples of resources include storage, processing power, memory and network bandwidth.
