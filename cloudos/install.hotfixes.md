# Install Hot Fixes

This topic describes the steps to import and apply hot fixes to your deployed clouds.  

If you have already downloaded a package to your client's local filesystem, 
and you need to add its functionality to your cloud:

1. From the Operational Dashboard's Cloud tab, click Hot Fix.

2. Click Import and browse to the .CSU file that contains the hot fix.

3. Follow the dialogs to apply the hot fix.

## Configure Option

**Internal note**: This feature might be removed from Cosmos in G3 - waiting for final word.

Click the Configure option to sign up for an HP Web Catalog account, or login with your credentials.

In the CODN catalog, search for relevant functionality.  This could include:

* Hot fixes (patches) to your version of HP Cloud OS.

* An HP Moonshot workload that you want to execute on your cloud environment.  This could include portions of HP Cloud OS such as a customized Glance image and Focus topology document, which you could then deploy to your HP Moonshot chassis.  

* Specific VMs that support High Availability (HA) Apache servers.

* Or other value-added software, such as a Microsoft Outlook Mail Server, to be used as a resource in your cloud.
