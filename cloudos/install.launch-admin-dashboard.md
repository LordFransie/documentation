# Launch the Administration Dashboard

After a cloud environment has been created in the HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard, you manage the cloud
through the HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard. The Administration Dashboard provides a simplified means
of creating and managing Cloud resources, infrastructure topology templates, and resource binding
documents.  The Administration Dashboard also enables you to provision a composite topology described by the topology
templates and binding documents.

To access the Administration Dashboard:

1. On the Operational Dashboard, select the Cloud tab, then Manage Clouds.

2. Select More > Launch Dashboard.   

3. Login to the Administration Dashboard with the Admin account and password you specified on the Create Cloud > Attributes dialog, as described in the [Create Your Cloud](/cloudos/install/create-your-cloud/) topic.
Or, use the default login: Admin / secretword.

4. Click Sign In.

## Next Step

For details about the Administration Dashboard, see the [HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard Help](/cloudos/admin-dashboard/index.htm) (not deployed to the live server yet).

While you are still in the Operational Dashboard, check the license details for your instance. 
See the next topic, [Check the Cloud OS License](/cloudos/install/license/).
