# Launch the Administration Dashboard

After a cloud environment has been created in the HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard, you manage the cloud
through the HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard. The Administration Dashboard provides a simplified means
of creating and managing Cloud resources, infrastructure topology templates, and resource binding
documents.  The Administration Dashboard also enables you to provision a composite topology described by the topology
templates and binding documents.

To access the Administration Dashboard:

1. On the Operational Dashboard, select the Cloud tab, then Manage Clouds.

2. Select More > Launch Dashboard.   

3. Login to the Administration Dashboard with the Admin account and password you specified on the Create Cloud > Attributes dialog, as described in the [Create Your Cloud](/cloudos/install/create-your-cloud/) topic.
Or, use the default login: Admin / secretword.

4. Click Sign In.

## Next Step

For details about the Administration Dashboard, see the [HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard Help](/cloudos/admin-dashboard/index.htm) (not deployed to the live server yet).

Before leaving the Operational Dashboard, you should get familiar with certain tasks that you may perform, as needed, 
related to Cloud OS updates and extensions. See the next topic, [Updates and  Your Cloud(/cloudos/install/updates-extensions/).
