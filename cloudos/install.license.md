# Check the Cloud OS License

This topic describes the steps to review and update your HP Cloud OS license. 

## Introduction

The HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard and Administration Dashboard require a common, date-based HP Cloud OS license. From the time you first launch the Operational Dashboard, you have (by default) 90 days of use.  After 90 
days, you may still open the Operational Dashboard and Administration Dashboard. However, until you renew the license, you cannot use any of the remaining modifiable features such as managing updates or extensions to your deployed cloud. 

## Check Your License

After you have completed the Admin node installation in the Operational Dashboard:

1. Click Settings in the top banner.

2. Click Licensing.

3. In the licensing information, note the number of days remaining on the current license.

## Get a New License

When your license expires, contact HP Support to purchase a renewed license. Then in the Operational Dashboard: 

1. Click Settings in the top banner.

2. Click Licensing.

3. In the licensing information, note the Instance ID value for your cloud.  
The HP Support representative will need this value when your new license is generated. 

4. Now enter the license key (alphanumeric characters) given to you by the HP Support representative. 

## Next Step

Before leaving the Operational Dashboard, you should become familiar with certain tasks that you may perform, as needed, 
to [Install Hot Fixes](/cloudos/install/hot-fixes/).
