# Install &amp; Configure Your Cloud

Welcome! The following topics explain how to install &amp; configure your cloud with the HP Cloud OS platform. 

It's important to read the topics and perform the described steps in order. While some steps are optional, 
the sequence that you'll follow in the HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard user interface is significant, to ensure 
a proper deployment of your cloud. 

Install and set up the Admin node:

* [Installation Overview](/cloudos/install/overview/)
* [Before You Install](/cloudos/install/before-you-install/)
* [Set Admin Node Prerequisites (Required)](/cloudos/install/admin-node-prerequisites/)
* [Customize Server Types (Optional)](/cloudos/install/customize-server-types/)
* [Customize Network Connections (Optional)](/cloudos/install/customize-network-connections/)
* [Customize Network Settings (Required)](/cloudos/install/customize-network-settings/)
* [Complete Admin Node Installation (Required)](/cloudos/install/complete-admin-node-installation/)

After you install and set up the Admin node, you can perform additional steps:

* [Create a Cloud](/cloudos/install/create-cloud/) 
* [Launch Administration Dashboard](/cloudos/install/launch-admin-dashboard/)
* [Check the HP Cloud OS License](/cloudos/install/license/)
* [Install Hot Fixes](/cloudos/install/hot-fixes/)
* [Updates and Extensions](/cloudos/install/updates-and-extensions/)

Finally, if you do not intend to use the wizard-based Cloud OS installation process that's described in 
the Create a Cloud topic, and instead decide to apply and configure the install modules yourself, 
see these topics: 

* [Advanced Cloud Setup](/cloudos/install/advanced-cloud-setup/)
* [Install Modules Reference](/cloudos/install/install-modules-reference/)

**Note:** Also see the Help topics that are available in the Operational Dashboard and Administration Dashboard.  Website copies are available:

* [HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard Help](/cloudos/manage/operational-dashboard/)
* [HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard Help](/cloudos/manage/administration-dashboard/)
