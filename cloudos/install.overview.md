# Cloud OS Installation - Overview

Welcome! This topic presents an overview of the installation steps.  

An HP Cloud OS infrastructure requires planning and preparation by IT Administrators to set up,
configure, and install a specific network, storage, and hardware infrastructure. 

These installation topics provide the means to plan, install, configure, and create an HP Cloud OS infrastructure.

The HP Cloud OS installation deploys the HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard (used to set up,
configure, and install an HP cloud infrastructure) and the HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard
(used to create and manage cloud resources).

## HP Cloud OS Environment

The HP Cloud OS environment consists of an installer, services and controllers that provide:
Simplified service delivery with automated-live content distribution and easier installation and
configuration processes. This allows manually intensive operational processes to be reduced from
hundreds of steps over multiple packages to a simple, automated process.

Optimized cloud workload across cloud providers with model once and provision anywhere
capability combined with repeatable, consistent workload placement across diverse cloud
deployment models. This allows your customers to optimally align workloads with resources and
improve resource utilization.

Flexible and open architecture powered by OpenStack, gives you an industry leading, vendor
neutral, open source cloud architecture.
