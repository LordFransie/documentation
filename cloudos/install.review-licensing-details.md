# Review Licensing Details

This topic describes the steps to review the licensing details for your instance of the HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard. 

## Introduction

The Operational Dashboard requires a date-based HP Cloud OS license. From the date your first open the Operational Dashboard, you have (by default) 90 days of use.  After 90 
days, you may still open the Operational Dashboard but you cannot use any of the remaining modifiable features, such as performing updates or managing extensions to your cloud environment, until 
you renew the license.

The same date-based Cloud OS license also controls the Administration Dashboard and its features.

## Check Your License

After you have completed the Admin node installation, to check your license:

1. In the Operational Dashboard, click Settings in the top banner.

2. Click Licensing.

3. In the licensing information, note the number of days remaining on the current license.

## Get a New License

When your license expires, affecting the Operational Dashboard and the Administration Dashboard, contact HP Support to purchase a renewed license. 

1. In the Operational Dashboard, click Settings in the top banner.

2. Click Licensing.

3. In the licensing information, enter the license key (alphanumeric characters) that was given to you by the HP Support representative. 

## Next Step

Before leaving the Operational Dashboard, you should become familiar with certain tasks that you may perform, as needed, 
with the Cloud OS updates and extensions. See the next topic, [Updates and Extensions](/cloudos/install/updates-extensions/).
