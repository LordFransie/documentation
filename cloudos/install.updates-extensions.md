# Updates &amp; Extensions 

This topic describes the steps to apply updates (such as hot fixes) or extensions, or both, to your deployed clouds. While the extensions 
may be optional, the updates from HP may be recommended by HP Support, as determined by your requirements and discussion with the support representative.

Will add the updates &amp; extensions info here... this is just a PLACEHOLDER.
