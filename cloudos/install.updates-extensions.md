# Updates &amp; Extensions

While the extensions may be optional, the updates from HP may be recommended by HP Support, as determined by your requirements 
and discussion with the support representative.

If you followed the automated steps to create your cloud, which provided a default set of install modules, you are done and may proceed to the Administration Dashboard. 
However, if you need to customize values in the install modules that are not exposed in the Create Cloud Attributes tab, see the next topic, [Advanced Cloud Setup](/cloudos/advanced-cloud-setup/).
