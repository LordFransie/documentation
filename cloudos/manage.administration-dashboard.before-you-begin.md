# Before You Begin with the Administration Dashboard Help

Before you begin with the HP Helion Cloud OS Administration Dashboard Help, take a few minutes to understand how the help content is organized. 
You can find information in this suggested order:

* Conceptual introduction and prerequisites. See [Welcome to the HP Helion Cloud OS Administration Dashboard](/cloudos/manage/administration-dashboard/welcome/). 

* A Getting Started topic that provides instructions for how to begin using the dashboard. You can read about responsibilities for each user role, 
and follow links to step-by-step instructions for performing tasks. See [Getting Started with the Administration Dashboard](/cloudos/manage/administration-dashboard/getting-started/). 

* Step-by-step instructions for working with deployment profiles and topology designs. See [Topology Designs](/cloudos/manage/administration-dashboard/topology-designs/).

* A topic that lists all tasks for each role. Use this section to learn which tasks each role can and should perform in the dashboard. 
(This is a comprehensive list, unlike Getting Started.) See [Administration Dashboard Tasks by Role](/cloudos/manage/administration-dashboard/tasks-by-role/).

* A topic that provides step-by-step instructions for tasks. This section's organization is based on the user interface tabs and windows. 
See [Administration Dashboard Tasks by Tab](/cloudos/manage/administration-dashboard/tasks-by-tab/).

Also, for your convenience, troubleshooting tips are organized and presented in the [Troubleshooting](/cloudos/manage/troubleshooting/) topic.
