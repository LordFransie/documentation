# Topology Designs

You can use the dashboard's designer to create and manage topology designs for straightforward IaaS deployments. 
Your topology designs become the recipes for automating the cloud. The designer allows you to design in a free-form 
layout where connection relationships implicitly define the service fulfillment lifecycle.

HP Cloud OS is the provider for your designs. Available components are determined by the OpenStack version (for example Diablo, Grizzly) you 
select within HP Cloud OS. As part of creating a design, you add nodes and connectors and set properties in the <b>Editor</b> tab. Use the <b>Validation</b> 
tab at any time to view details about design errors.

After creating the design, you can optionally create one or more <b>Profiles</b> based on that design which allows you to override some 
of the original configuration properties. Profiles create an association to a design document and allow you to set different 
values such as flavors, machine images, or keypairs.

Click <b>Project</b> > <b>Provisioning</b> > <b>Topology Designs</b> to access the designer. A list of existing designs and their status display in the 
<b>Browse Designs</b> window.

Tasks are organized by the following tabs:

### How to Lay Out a Topology Design

For information on how to create a new design, see [How to Create a Topology Design](#how-to-create-a-topology-design).

After creating the design, you then select and arrange the free-form component nodes and connectors in the Editor.

To create the topology design layout, follow the instructions in the following sections.

#### Nodes

As you move your cursor around the canvas in the Editor, gray tiles display. Clicking a tile presents you with a list of available node types 
determined by the Cloud Profile.

A new blank design displays at least one validation error indicating the design layout is unsaved. As you add nodes, more validation issues will 
display until you set required properties for the nodes and save the design.

By default, the system proposes a Name for the node consisting of the node type and a sequential number, e.g., Network Segment 1. This name can be changed 
by editing the node properties.

#### Connectors

Connectors are used to establish relationships between nodes, for example between a Server Group and a Volume Group. Line connectors represent one or 
more purposes for the connection between two nodes, even though there is a single line displayed. This design helps prevent excess visual display and 
allows the connector to represent multiple networking relationships.

You can add a connector and a node in a single operation by dragging a connector from a node to an empty tile. There you will be presented with a list of 
valid nodes for connection. You can also select a node and drag the blue circle from either side and drop it on the canvas in position. Only valid nodes 
display for selection.

If connector properties are required, the connector displays a validation error.

**Rules for node and connector layout**

The system validates the following rules as you create a design:

* You can only set node properties in the Editor if you selected a Resource Pool during design creation.

* Only a Router node, a Load Balancer Service node, or a Server Group node can be connected to an External Network node.

* Only a Server Group node and a Load Balancer Service node can be connected to a Network Segment node.

* Only a Network Segment node and an External Network node can be connected to a Router node.

* A Server Group node can be connected to all other nodes. A Server Group node must be connected to a Network Segment node to make it accessible to an end user after it is created in a service.

* A Volume Group node must be connected to a Server Group node to create a valid topology.

#### Design steps

<ol>

<li> After you create a new design, the Editor opens with a blank canvas.

<li> Left-click a tile to add the first node.

<li> Select a topology node type from the list, which is populated according to the Cloud Profile selected during design creation. As you hover over a node, 
a tool tip displays. Possible node options are shown in this table:  <br /> <br />

</table> 

</li> 

<li> The node icon and name display on the canvas in the selected tile and node Properties display in the right panel. NOTE: The red "x" on the node and the red text in the Properties panel indicate that properties need to be updated before saving. These missing properties are flagged as invalid and are tracked in the Validation tab.
    
<li> With the node selected (blue highlighting), drag one of the blue circles on either side of the node and drop. You are presented with a list of valid nodes.
    
<li> Make your selection from the list of available nodes.

<li> Repeat steps 5 and 6 to design your template.

## Deployment Profiles

**Concepts:**

When you create a topology design, the properties you set for the nodes become the default configuration for the design. 
Within HP Cloud OS, this original configuration displays as the Default Profile in the Provisioning > Deployment Profiles area. 
Profiles provide a way to override the default configuration by allowing you to set different values for node properties such as 
flavors, machine images, or keypairs. Profiles create an association to a binding document. Profiles are optional and are not required 
in order to publish a design. For more information, see [How to Publish or Unpublish a Topology Design](#how-to-publish-or-unpublish-a-topology-design).

Profiles are validated by the topology designer and tracked in the Validation tab. The validation process checks that a profile contains 
valid values for the configuration properties that are being overwritten.

You can create as many profiles as needed. You can create a new profile based on an existing profile.  
This can save you time and effort if the profiles have similar configurations. This process copies all the nodes, connectors, and 
properties of the original profile into the new profile where you can then change the properties.

To view profiles and details:

1. On the Project tab, select a Current Project.
    
2. Click Provisioning > Topology Designs to open the Browse Designs window.
    
3. From Browse Designs, select the design for which you want to view profiles.
   
4. Click the Profiles tab. A list of existing profiles displays.
    
5. Select a profile. The profile opens in the Overview tab, showing the Name, Description, Changed Properties and a visual representation of the topology design. NOTE: The linked path at the top of this window allows you to move back as needed.

## Validation

**Concepts:**

Validation is a continuing process during design creation, configuration, and editing. 

Topology Designs provides a validation log where you can view details about all design issues in one place. In addition to this log, you will see red validation flags as you create a design in the Editor and create Profiles. 

The validation process checks that a Profile contains all the required configuration properties, e.g., that Flavor is set for a server group node.

Within the Editor, the following artifacts are validated:

* Document properties

* Node properties

* Connector properties

Rules regarding saving, validation, and publishing:

* You can create and save a design with validation errors.

* You can create and save a profile with errors.

* You cannot save a profile that has errors if the underlying design is published.

As part of the validation process, any new node that is added in the Editor immediately displays with an Unsaved icon () and a list of specific property errors highlighted in the right panel. Within the Validation tab, you can click on the artifact name to be 
linked back to the source of the error.

The Validation tab can be accessed at any time during the design process. 

**Tasks:**

### How to View Validation Errors

1. On the Project tab, select a Current Project.

2. Click Provisioning > Topology Designs to open the Browse Designs window.

3. Select the design.
   
4. From the Overview tab, click the Validation tab.

5. Within this window, a table displays with:
   * The icon associated with a component
   * The name of the component, which is a direct link to the component so you can update
   * A brief description of issues with the component

6. Click a linked validation item to move to the source of the issue and correct.
