# Topology Designs

You can use the dashboard's designer to create and manage topology designs for straightforward IaaS deployments. 
Your topology designs become the recipes for automating the cloud. The designer allows you to design in a free-form 
layout where connection relationships implicitly define the service fulfillment lifecycle.

HP Cloud OS is the provider for your designs. Available components are determined by the OpenStack version (for example Diablo, Grizzly) you 
select within HP Cloud OS. As part of creating a design, you add nodes and connectors and set properties in the Editor tab. Use the Validation 
tab at any time to view details about design errors.

After creating the design, you can optionally create one or more Profiles based on that design which allows you to override some 
of the original configuration properties. Profiles create an association to a design document and allow you to set different 
values such as flavors, machine images, or keypairs.

Click Project > Provisioning > Topology Designs to access the designer. A list of existing designs and their status display in the 
Browse Designs window.

Tasks are organized by the following tabs:
