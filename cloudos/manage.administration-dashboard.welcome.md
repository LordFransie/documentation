## Why You Use the Administration Dashboard

You can use the Administration Dashboard as a simplified means of creating and managing HP Cloud OS resources, topology designs, and deployment profiles.

The Administration Dashboard also provides the ability to provision a composite topology described by the topology templates and infrastructure design 
documents. The Administration Dashboard is associated with a single cloud. 

You can use the Administration Dashboard to view, allocate, and manage all virtual resources within a cloud. 

## Administration Dashboard Look and Feel

**Concepts:**

The Administration Dashboard provides customized views by role. You see only the tabs and panels you need to do your job.

## Prerequisites to Accessing the Administration Dashboard

Before you can access the HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard, someone in your organization must use the HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard 
to install, set up, configure, and stand up a cloud environment. Use Operational Dashboard to set up and install an Admin node, create a cloud, 
define compute regions, and apply updates and extensions to your cloud. See the [HP Cloud OS Operational Dashboard Help](/cloudos/manage/operational-dashboard/).

For instructions on how to use an advanced method of installing a cloud, see [Install and Configure Your Clouds](/cloudos/install).
