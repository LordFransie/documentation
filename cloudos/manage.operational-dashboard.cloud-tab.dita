<p>The Manage Nodes panel lists all of the nodes that have been discovered through the PXE-boot process. Nodes that are Allocated can be 
subsequently used as part of a Cloud installation. Nodes can be edited so that they have meaningful names or descriptions. Clicking on a node's 
ID gives more information about that node, including its role in a cloud deployment.</p>
<p>Before you begin:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have console access to all the virtual and baremetal servers. This is required to power on the servers to trigger Network (PXE) boot, monitor 
operating system installation and if need be provide additional firmware drivers when prompted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network and storage infrastructures are set up correctly. For the post-install of the operating system, a few steps are required to configure 
and mount the folder on an additional storage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Note:</b> Ensure that the boot order on all nodes is configured to 
boot from the network first (this only occurs once as the PXE service will not try to network boot a node again if it has already done so).</p>
<p>For procedural instructions on setting up and configuring your nodes, see <xref href="../cloudos/install.dita" >Install and Configure Your Cloud</xref>.</p>

<p>To access: Select the Cloud tab &gt; Manage Nodes.</p>
<p> <b>Tip:</b> Access the virtual and baremetal server's consoles 
to monitor operating system installation. Some of your hardware requires non-free firmware files to operate. The firmware can be loaded from removable media, 
such as a USB stick or CD/DVD.</p>
<p>If a dialog displays prompting you to load missing firmware, provide the appropriate drive.</p>

<p>The Manage Clouds panel lists the cloud that has been deployed in the current environment and the compute region(s). 
There is no limit to the number of compute regions that can be created and deployed, other than resource limitations.</p>
<p>The simplest cloud has one Compute Region with one Compute Controller that manages all the compute nodes. After creating an active cloud, 
you can go back and add more regions as your cloud environment expands. Or, you can plan to include several compute regions in your cloud 
depending on your environment.</p>
<p>There are multiple use cases where you would prefer to have separate compute regions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To accommodate a heterogeneous set of hardware configured for different workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To distribute the workload across regions to get better response times. Each region can contain dedicated endpoints with a full Nova installation 
including its own message queue and database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Note:</b> Each region must use unique 
nodes â€” managed nodes cannot be shared between regions.</p>

<p>To access: Select the Cloud tab &gt; Manage Clouds and then click <b>More</b> &gt; <b>Reduce Compute Region</b> for the corresponding cloud.</p>
<p>The Reduce Compute Region dialog is used to remove compute nodes from an existing compute region. 
When a node is successfully removed from a compute region, its previous context is lost, including its alias name and any HP Cloud OS software 
that had been previously installed on it. To use such a node again, re-set its alias and re-allocate it. Once in the Allocated state, 
the node can be associated with a cloud.</p>
<p> <b>Note:</b> You reset a node's alias in the Edit Node Dialog, 
and you re-allocate it in the Manage Nodes Page.</p>

<p>To access: Select the Cloud tab &gt; Manage Clouds and then click <b>More</b> &gt; <b>Remove Compute Region</b> for the corresponding cloud.</p>
<p>The Remove Compute Region dialog is used to remove an existing compute region. This action sets the compute controller and compute 
nodes that comprise the compute region to the Not Allocated state. In the Not Allocated state, the previous context of such nodes is lost, 
including their alias names and any Cloud OS software that had been previously installed on them. To use such nodes again, reset 
their aliases and reallocate them. Once in the Allocated state, they can be associated with a cloud.</p>
<p>
<b>Notes:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the compute controller is co-located with the cloud controller, the compute region cannot be removed.</li>
<li>You reset a node's alias in the Edit Node Dialog, and re-allocate it in the Manage Nodes Page.</li>
<li>You can remove the last compute region from the cloud, in which case, it becomes a hybrid-only cloud. This is useful when provisioning 
should be done in a public cloud, such as HP Cloud.</li>
