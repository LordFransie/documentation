<p>The first step on the Operational Dashboard is to configure the HP Cloud OS Administration node prerequisites.</p>
<p> <b>Caution:</b> 
Any prerequisites you want to configure, must be done before you complete the steps on the Complete Install panel. 
For details, see <xref href="../cloudos/manage.operational-dashboard.environment-tab.dita#complete-install" >Complete Install</xref>. 
After that, the Edit Prerequisite dialogs are read-only. Once the install process is triggered, no changes can be made. 
If you want to make changes, you need to start over by re-installing the HP Cloud OS Administration node. 
For procedural instructions, see <xref href="../cloudos/install.dita" >Install and Configure Your Cloud</xref>.

<p> <b>Caution:</b> If you plan to customize the servers, 
you must do that before you complete the steps on the Complete Install panel. For details, see 
the <xref href="../cloudos/manage.operational-dashboard.environment-tab.dita#complete-install" >Complete Install</xref> topic.
After that, the Server Types dialogs are read-only. Once the install process is triggered,

</p>
<p>The Server Types panel allows you to capture new or use existing server definitions about the networking ports for various servers in 
your baremetal cloud environment. If all servers in your cloud are the same server type (homogeneous nodes), you are not required to 
configure anything in this view. HP recommends that you keep and accept the default settings.</p>
<p>However, if the servers in your cloud are different types of servers, you may be required to use a Linux utility such as dmidecode to 
get the pattern and CLI commands to determine the bus addresses of your server's network ports.</p>
<p>Here is one way to get the values for Server Name Pattern and Bus Order:</p>
<p>Server Name Pattern:</p>
<codeblock>
dmidecode | grep "Product Name"
</codeblock>
<p>Bus Order (for UbuntuOS):</p>
<codeblock>
ls -l /sys/class/net | egrep pci | sed -e 's/^.*pci//' -e 's%/net.*$%%'
</codeblock>
<p>This is necessary to define the correct order of those ports for the various server types so that all the servers have the 
same enumeration of network ports (0, 1, 2, 3 and so on) across the cloud. If you do not configure the server types for a cloud with 
heterogeneous nodes in this way, you will experience networking failures because the servers will not have the same network port enumeration order.</p>
<p> <b>Tip:</b> Based on your network and hardware infrastructure, 
you can accept defaults or customize Server Types.

<p>The connections are defined based on the Network Modes along with a list of logical interfaces and the corresponding 
physical interfaces' ports and bandwidth. For each logical connection (intf0, intf1, intf2) the network type is 
identified (admin, os_sdn, public). The os_sdn value stands for OpenStack(R) Software-Defined-Network.</p>
<p>Examples of Network Modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Mode: All connections are shared on the same physical interface through VLAN.</li>
<li>Dual Mode: All connections have their own interfaces where VLAN and bridge are off.</li>
<li>Team Mode: All connections are shared on the same two physical interfaces through VLAN. Teaming means treating the wires like a single bundle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of Logical Interface values:</p>
<codeblock>
intf0 (admin, bmc_vlan)
intf1 (os_sdn)
intf2 (public)
</codeblock>
<p>Examples of Physical Interface values:</p>
<codeblock>
1Gb (preferred) on 1st port
1Gb (preferred) on 2nd port
1Gb (preferred) on 3rd port
</codeblock>
<p>In this Dual mode example, "1Gb (preferred) on 2nd port" means a one gigabit network for port 2, as enumerated by default from the 
server's BIOS or as overridden in the Server Types panel. The "preferred" tag suggests that if the NIC/port does not support 1Gb, HP Cloud 
OS falls back to the next maximum speed supported by the NIC or port. However, if there is no preferred tag, it means the port has to 
support 1Gb; otherwise the deployment might not succeed.</p>
<p>Following are some of the criteria to be considered when making changes to the default settings.</p>
<p>In Dual mode, the default settings assume that all the nodes have their interfaces wired as:</p>
<codeblock>
eth0 - admin network
eth1 - os_sdn network
eth2 - public/external network
</codeblock>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> In such a scenario, keep the default values intact.</p>
<p>In Dual mode, if the wiring of networks between the nodes are non-contiguous and/or not in sequence, you need to change the default mapping:</p>
<p>
<b>Example 1:</b> For all the nodes, eth0 - admin; eth1 - public, eth2 - private; the Connections table must be customized to look like the following:</p>
<codeblock>
intf0 - 1Gb (preferred) on 1st port
intf1 - 1Gb (preferred) on 3rd port
intf2 - 1Gb (preferred) on 2nd port
</codeblock>
<p>
<b>Example 2:</b> For all the nodes, eth0 - admin, eth2 - os_sdn, eth4 - public/external the Connections table must be customized to look like the following:</p>
<codeblock>
intf0 - 1Gb (preferred) on 1st port
intf1 - 1Gb (preferred) on 3rd port
intf2 - 1Gb (preferred) on 5th port
</codeblock>
<p>In Single mode, keep the defaults. It is assumed that eth0 port is configured on the switch to support tagged VLANs (discussed in the next section).</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Interface mapping must be identical on all the nodes.</p>
<p>In Team mode, configure virtual connections to use both trunks. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map eth0, eth2, and eth4 to trunk 1.</li>
<li>Map eth1, eth3, and eth5 to trunk 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in this example, the eth0 and eth1 interfaces belongs to same VLAN; the same is true for the eth2 and eth3 pair, and the eth4 and eth5 pair. 
When the HP Cloud OS Administration node allocates the baremetal server, Cloud OS should create a teaming NIC using the NIC pairs.</p>
<p>Here's a partial example of how the Team mode configuration could look on this Connections dialog:</p>

<section id="networks-panel-overview"> <title>Networks Panel Overview</title>
<p>On the Networks panel, you define the networks that are used in your IT environment. For each logical connection (intf0, intf1, intf2) a network 
is defined (admin, os_sdn, and public). These definitions are used for various purposes in the cloud such as networking between the nodes and 
the Cloud OS Administration node (using the admin network), the public or corporate network (such as public network) attached to your cloud, 
or networking between the Virtual Machine instances and the traffic from the instances to the Cloud Controller Node (using the os_sdn network).</p>
<p> <b>Important:</b> Customizing the public network settings is 
critical. Any missing or incorrect values will result in you having to re-install the HP Cloud OS Administration node. 
For procedural instructions, see <xref href="../cloudos/install.dita" >Install and Configure Your Cloud</xref>.
</p>
<p>Following are some of the criteria to be considered while making changes to the default settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The default settings "Dual" assume you have a separate physical network for each interface; the admin, os_sdn, and public network across the Cloud OS Administration node and all managed nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a production type of deployment and to reduce the complexities of configuring the switches, it is strongly recommended that you provide separate wired networks for public, os_sdn and admin. This requires you to specify your own range of IP addresses and other settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some networks and address ranges for those networks are provided by default. You can modify or delete the IP address ranges as well as add new ones. You must use valid ranges that fall within the subnet as defined by the subnet address and mask specified in the network details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you edit the network IP address ranges and enter invalid ranges, you will get a validation error when you click Update Address Ranges in the Edit Address Ranges dialog. The validation error shows the invalid address (start or end) and the corresponding network type. You must fix all errors in the Edit Address Ranges dialog and click <b>Update Address Ranges</b> to validate the addresses are correct. Clicking Cancel will not trigger the validation step.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Caution:</b> The address ranges validation only occurs when you 
open the Edit Address Ranges dialog for each network and click <b>Update Address Ranges</b>. Otherwise,you will not know if you have any errors. 
However, the Complete Install step will run a validation check and cannot be completed until the errors are fixed. If there is an address 
range error, the validation check will show the network type and possibly the address value. If not, open the Edit Address Ranges dialog 
for the specified network and click <b>Update Address Ranges</b> to identify the incorrect address. For details, see 
<xref href="../cloudos/manage.operational-dashboard.environment-tab.dita#complete-install" >Complete Install</xref>.

<p>On the Complete Install panel, you complete the HP Cloud OS Administration node installation, which installs underlying components on the Administration node.</p>
<p>You specify the install settings on the Confirm Complete Install Dialog and then finish the install process on the Complete Install Page.</p>
<p> <b>Note:</b> The Complete Install step runs a validation check 
of the network IP address ranges. If there is an error, this step cannot be completed until the error is fixed. 
The validation check shows the network type and possibly the address value. You must open the Edit Address Ranges dialog for the specified 
network and click <b>Update Address Ranges</b> to identify the incorrect address, and fix it. 
See <xref href="../cloudos/manage.operational-dashboard.environment-tab.dita#edit-address-ranges-dialog" >Edit Address Ranges Dialog</xref>.
</p>
<p>When the install is complete, the Operational Dashboard displays the Cloud tab (see the <xref href="../cloudos/manage.operational-dashboard.cloud-tab.dita" >Cloud Tab</xref> section of this topic), after the user clicks the Continue... button.</p>
<p> <b>Caution:</b> Be sure the values for the 
Prerequisites, Server Types, Connections and Networks are what you need, before you start the install process. Once the install process is triggered, 
no changes can be made. If you want to make changes, you need to start over by re-installing the HP Cloud OS Administration node.
