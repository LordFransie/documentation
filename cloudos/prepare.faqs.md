of OpenStack technology that provides the foundation for the Cloud common architecture across private, public, and hybrid cloud delivery. HP Cloud OS is targeted to meet the needs of enterprises who want to leverage OpenStack technology for rapid innovation, and the beneficial 
economics of an open source approach. It enables easier deployment, application portability, and streamlined OpenStack patching and updates, among other features.

* OpenStack distribution
* HP installer
* Automated patch and OpenStack release management capability
* Standards-based infrastructure and application modeling capability
* Cloud platform monitoring

## What is OpenStack?

OpenStack is a cloud computing project aimed at providing a cloud operating system, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It is free and open source software released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License. The project is managed by the OpenStack 
Foundation, a non-profit corporate entity established in September 2012 to promote OpenStack software and its community. The technology consists of a series of interrelated projects that control pools of processing, storage, and networking 
resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering its users to provision resources through a web interface.
  
## What are the HP differentiators?

HP Cloud is based on a common architecture. This enables HP to provide its customers with choice, confidence, and consistency.

* Choice &mdash; HP Cloud enables the customer to choose from any combination of: cloud delivery model (public, private or managed); OS; hypervisor; combination of infrastructure elements; and partners.
* Confidence &mdash; HP Cloud allows the customer to manage and secure the delivery of applications and services across a combination of delivery models (public, private, managed); and provides the confidence that the cloud will scale - with the appropriate SLA expectations - for future business needs.
* Consistency &mdash; HP Cloud provides the customer with a common architecture, and allows for workload portability across delivery models - providing the customer with a single consumption experience.

## What does HP Cloud OS support?

## What is the HP Cloud OS technology preview?

To allow customers to evaluate and educate themselves on an OpenStack-based architecture for their cloud needs, HP offers the HP Cloud OS technology preview for developers and sysadmins. This helps customers and partners gain experience with OpenStack prior to deploying HP Cloud solutions that leverage HP Cloud OS. 

The HP Cloud OS technology preview is an OpenStack distribution from HP that contains a HP installer, a standards-based infrastructure, and application modeling capability. It provides an in-depth insight for customers and partners prior to deploying HP Cloud solutions that leverage HP Cloud OS.  HP Cloud OS technology preview is not supported, and is meant for non-production, 
limited scale (up to 10 compute nodes) and limited time (90-day) use. 

## How is HP Cloud OS integrated into the HP Cloud portfolio? 

HP Cloud OS is already powering or compatible with several existing HP cloud solutions, delivering on our commitment to a common architecture across the HP Cloud portfolio with HP Cloud OS as a foundational technology component embedded in our existing cloud solutions and new innovative offerings. This technology provides the foundation for the common cloud architecture across private, public, and managed cloud delivery models.  Today, HP Cloud OS is NOT a product, but rather a technology that will be offered and supported as part of other HP products.

* CloudSystem currently embeds OpenStack technology, offering customers greater choice in deployment options for their cloud workloads by enabling KVM resource pools.  The next generation of CloudSystem software was built on Cloud OS technology (coming in 2014).
* Moonshot servers will be available with Cloud OS technology to simplify the provisioning and management of Moonshot servers for specific cloud workloads, such as dedicated hosting and large-scale websites.  This is currently available as a private beta.  HP Moonshot with HP Cloud OS may be available in 2014.
