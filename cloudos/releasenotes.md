# HP Cloud OS Release Notes

Internal notes:

* Content will be posted on [docs.hpcloud.com/cloudos/releasenotes/] (not deployed to the live server yet).

* For now, the GitHub repo that will contain that file can only work within the DevExDocs/docs.hpcloud.com, which is separate from the DevExDocs/documentation repo that contains this file.
