# Getting Started with HP Cloud OS Identity Service #

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->

Based on Keystone, the OpenStack Identity Service, the HP Cloud Identity Service provides one-stop authentication for all HP Public Cloud offerings. Key terms include:

- User -- A digital representation of a person, system, or service who uses HP Public Cloud. The Identity Service validates that incoming requests are being made by the user who claims to be making the call. Users have a login and may be assigned tokens to access resources. Users can scope their authentication to a tenant which then limits where and how their tokens can be used to interact with services. Users are associated with tenants based on roles assigned to them with that tenant.

- Credentials -- Data that belongs to, is owned by, and generally only known by a user that the user can present to prove they are who they are (since nobody else should know that data).

- Authentication -- In the context of the Identity Service, the act of confirming the identity of a user or the truth of a claim. The Identity Service will confirm that incoming request are being made by the user who claims to be making the call by validating a set of claims that the user is making. These claims are initially in the form of a set of credentials (username & password, or user access keys). After initial confirmation, the Identity Service will issue the user a token which the user can then provide to demonstrate that their identity has been authenticated when making subsequent requests.

- Token -- An arbitrary bit of text that is used to access resources. Each token has a scope which describes which resources are accessible with it. While the Identity Service supports token-based authentication in this release, the intention is for it to support additional protocols in the future.

- Tenant -- A collection of HP service subscriptions and/or resources (Compute, Object Storage, etc).

- Endpoint -- A network-accessible address, usually described by URL, where a service may be accessed.

- Role -- A personality that a user assumes when performing a specific set of operations. A role includes a set of rights and privileges. A user assuming that role inherits those rights and privileges. A token that is issued to a user includes the list of roles that user can assume. Services that are being called by that user determine how they interpret the set of roles a user has and which operations or resources each roles grants access to.
