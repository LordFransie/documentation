# Getting Started with HP Cloud OS Networking Service #

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->

Leveraging OpenStack Networking, HP Cloud OS Networking is a virtual networking service that provides network connectivity and addressing for HP Cloud OS Compute devices.

In the 13.5 release, HP Cloud OS Compute and Networking services are separate entities, integrating services and providing new features.

You can use the default network to deploy HP Cloud OS compute virtual servers, or modify the default network to expand networking capabilities.

You can now define and configure your own virtual network topology, including control of IP address ranges.
