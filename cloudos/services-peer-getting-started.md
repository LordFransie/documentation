# Getting Started with HP Helion Cloud OS Peer Service #

<!-- modeled after HP Helion Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md); text from docs.hpcloud.com/cloudos/prepare/overview/ -->

The HP Helion Cloud OS Peer service (also known as *Graffiti*) is a pool registry and capability tagging service, that provides a dictionary of the "capabilities" of all the resources in a cloud environment.

The Peer service provides the ability to describe requirements and capabilities using a common ontology and to *tag* (or, assign) requirements and capabilities to cloud resources. 

You can then search for cloud resources using on tagged registered requirements and capabilities. 

Graffiti allows users to:

- Publish a common capability ontology
- Publish resources that are described by the Common Capability Ontology
- Select resource pools
- Search the Directory to find resource(s) based on required common capabilities
- Provision a topology binding
- Verify that the provisioning was successful in the cloud
