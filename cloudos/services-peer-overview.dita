<p>The HP CLoud OS Peer service (also known as <i>Graffiti</i>) is a pool registry and capability tagging service, that provides a dictionary of the "capabilities" of all the resources in a cloud environment.</p>
<p>The Peer service provides the ability to describe requirements and capabilities using a common ontology and to <i>tag</i> (or, assign) requirements and capabilities to cloud resources.</p>
<p>You can then search for cloud resources using on tagged registered requirements and capabilities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Publish a common capability ontology</li>
<li>Publish resources that are described by the Common Capability Ontology</li>
<li>Select resource pools</li>
<li>Search the Directory to find resource(s) based on required common capabilities</li>
<li>Provision a topology binding</li>
<li>Verify that the provisioning was successful in the cloud</li>
</ul>
