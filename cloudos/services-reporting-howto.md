# How To's with the HP Helion Cloud OS Telemetry and Reporting (Ceilometer) Service #

Collection

Except where noted, the collection actions for Ceilometer are internal functions that are triggered by messaging queue activity and generalized for all the services (i.e. Ceilometer's service-specific "plugins" all utilize the same methodology for outputting all data collected by Ceilometer). Output can be driven to queue-based messaging agents, log files, or data stores. Verification for non-API-driven use cases can be accomplished by checking for this output in the configured target (MySQL database by default).
