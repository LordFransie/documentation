# HP Cloud OS Volume Service Overview #

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->

Need more storage for your HP Cloud Compute instances? HP Block Storage is the way to go. With HP Cloud version 13.5 block storage is provided as a separate but integrated service based on OpenStack Cinder.

Once created, you can easily disconnect Block Storage volumes from one instance and attach them to another. You can also create Snapshots to easily copy a volume before making significant changes to it. Custom volumes ranging in sizes from 1 GB to 2 TB can be created using a variety of file system types.


###Using the API to access Networking### {#API}
 
You can use a low-level, raw REST API access to HP Cloud OS Volume service. See the [HP Cloud OS Block Storage Service API page](/api/v13/block-storage/).

###Using the CLI### {#cli}

You can use any of several command-line interface software to access HP Cloud OS Volume service. See [HP Cloud OS CLI](/cli/).

###Using language bindings### {#bindings}

You can use any of several language bindings to access HP Cloud OS Volume service. See [HP Cloud binding support](/bindings/).
