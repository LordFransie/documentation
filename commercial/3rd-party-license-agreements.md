The Apache Software Foundation uses various licenses to distribute software and 
documentation, to accept regular contributions from individuals and 
corporations, and to accept larger grants of existing software products.

These licenses help us achieve our goal of providing reliable and long-lived 
software products through collaborative open source software development. In all 
cases, contributors retain full rights to use their original contributions for 
any other purpose outside of Apache while providing the ASF and its projects the 
right to distribute and build upon their work within Apache.

Licensing of Distributions

All software produced by The Apache Software Foundation or any of its projects 
or subjects is licensed according to the terms of the documents listed below.

Apache License, Version 2.0 (current)

http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 ( TXT or HTML )

The 2.0 version of the Apache License was approved by the ASF in 2004. The goals 
of this license revision have been to reduce the number of frequently asked 
questions, to allow the license to be reusable without modification by any 
project (including non-ASF projects), to allow the license to be included by 
reference instead of listed in every file, to clarify the license on submission 
of contributions, to require a patent license on contributions that necessarily 
infringe the contributor's own patents, and to move comments regarding Apache 
and other inherited attribution notices to a location outside the license terms 
(the NOTICE file ).

The result is a license that is supposed to be compatible with other open source 
licenses, while remaining true to the original goals of the Apache Group and 
supportive of collaborative development across both nonprofit and commercial 
organizations. The Apache Software Foundation is still trying to determine if 
this version of the Apache License is compatible with the GPL.

All packages produced by the ASF are implicitly licensed under the Apache
 License, Version 2.0, unless otherwise explicitly stated. More developer
 documentation on how to apply the Apache License to your work can be found in * 
Applying the Apache License, Version 2.0 *.

Apache License, Version 1.1 (historic)

http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-1.1 

The 1.1 version of the Apache License was approved by the ASF in 2000. The
 primary change from the 1.0 license is in the 'advertising clause' (section 3 
of the 1.0 license); derived products are no longer required to include
 attribution in their advertising materials, only in their documentation.

Individual packages licensed under the 1.1 version may have used different
 wording due to varying requirements for attribution or mark identification, but 
the binding terms were all the same.

Apache License, Version 1.0 (historic)

http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-1.0 

This is the original Apache License which applies only to older versions of
 Apache packages (such as version 1.2 of the Web server).

Contributor License Agreements

The ASF desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to the 
Apache projects complete, sign, and submit (via postal mail, fax or email) an 
Individual Contributor License Agreement (1) (CLA) [ PDF form ]. The purpose of 
this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property 
has been contributed to the ASF and thereby allow us to defend the project 
should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A 
signed CLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights 
to an ASF project.

For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on an Apache project, a 
Corporate CLA (CCLA) is available for contributing intellectual property via the 
corporation, that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement. 
Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign 
their own CLA as an individual, to cover any of their contributions which are 
not owned by the corporation signing the CCLA.

CLAs may be submitted by traditional postal mail, fax, or by emailing a scan of 
the signed copy to secretary@apache.org. You can also fill out the pdf document 
or edit the text document, create a detached gpg signature, and send both the 
document and the detached signature via email to secretary.

Note: If you choose to send this document via fax then be absolutely sure that 
you have sent it correctly. Faxes are often received back-to-front, blank, or 
totally illegible.

The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to use 
one's personal email address in the contact details, rather than an @work
 address.

Your Full name will be published unless you provide an alternative Public name.
 For example if your full name is Andrew Bernard Charles Dickens, but you wish
 to be known as Andrew Dickens, please enter the latter as your Public name.

The email address and other contact details are not published.

(1) Please use overwrite mode when typing in the underlined fields. Otherwise 
the fields will wrap, making the result harder to read.

Software Grants

When an individual or corporation decides to donate a body of existing software 
or documentation to one of the Apache projects, they need to execute a formal 
Software Grant Agreement (SGA) with the ASF. Typically, this is done after 
negotiating approval with the ASF Incubator or one of the PMCs, since the ASF
 will not accept software unless there is a viable community available to
 support a collaborative project.

Grants may be submitted by traditional postal mail, fax, or by emailing a scan 
of the signed copy to secretary@. You can also edit the text document, create a 
detached gpg signature, and send both the document and the detached signature 
via email to secretary.

Note: If you choose to send this document via fax then be absolutely sure that 
you have sent it correctly. Faxes are often received back-to-front, blank, or 
totally illegible.
