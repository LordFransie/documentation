##Installing HP StoreVirtual VSA Centralized Management Console (CMC) on Linux {#install-hp-storevirtual-cmc}

In order to configure the HP StoreVirtual VSA nodes, you must first install the CMC. You can manage all connected StoreVirtual VSA instances from single CMC connected to HP Helion OpenStack management network.


### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

* You must be running the X Windows System to install the CMC.

* We recommend that you install CMC on the same KVM host that is used to run the seed VM. This host has direct network connectivity to servers running HP StoreVirtual VSA. However, you may select an alternate host as long as it is accessible from the HP Helion OpenStack management network.


**Note**: These changes are required for 64-bit operating system only.

* Execute the following commands:

		# apt-get update
		# dpkg --add-architecture i386
		# apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk:i386

### Installation {#installation}

1. Verify if the CMC installer file inside `tripleo` directory (packaged along with the HP Helion OpenStack&#174; installer) has the executable permission otherwise execute the following command:

		# chmod +x CMC_11.5.01.0079.0_Installer_Linux.bin

2. Launch the installer

		# ./CMC_11.5.01.0079.0_Installer_Linux.bin

3. Follow the steps in the console based installation wizard to complete the installation.

4. To start the CMC:<br>
 From the directory in which the files are installed, click the **HP Store Virtual Centralized Management Console** to launch CMC.  
</br>  

**Note**: To launch the CMC from command line (CLI), navigate to the location where it is installed and enter 
			
     # ./"HP Store Virtual Centralized Management Console".

##Deploying HP StoreVirtual VSA {#deploy-vsa}


###Prerequisites {#prerequisites-vsa}

Ensure the following prerequisites are fulfilled before HP StoreVirtual Storage systems are deployed:

* Before enrolling the new Baremetal server for StoreVirtual deployment, ensure that `#ironic node-list` in the undercloud server does not have any free nodes.This is required to register a new node which matches the disk requirements for StoreVirtual and is picked by the installer for StoreVirtual deployment.

 
* Ensure that you have created a minimum of two(2) RAID groups. You can create a maximum of eight(8) groups. The first RAID group where the OS image is deployed is not considered for StoreVirtual storage.

* Each physical disk should be RAID protected and should not be RAID 0. You can use RAID 5 and above. <!---For more details, refer - [**Storevirtual documentation LINK**]-->

* For deploying StoreVirtual systems without Adaptive Optimization (AO) the setup must have a minimum two(2) disks(/dev/sda, /dev/sdb).

* For deploying StoreVirtual systems with Adaptive Optimization (AO) the setup must have at least three(3) disks(/dev/sda, /dev/sdb,/dev/sdc). The disk /dev/sdb should be a Solid State Drive(SSD).


* Ensure that you create the RAID group for SSD drives immediately after creating the RAID group for boot volume. For example: If three RAID groups are to be created. The following is recommended :

      **Step 1**: Create the first RAID group for HDD drives and mark this as boot volume(/dev/sda)
        
	   **Step 2**: Create the second RAID group for SSD drives which should be used as Tier 0 for AO (/dev/sdb)
         
	   **Step 3**: Create the third RAID group for HDD drives which will be used as Tier 1(/dev/sdc)

* Seed Cloud is installed and is running.
 
* The bundled license for the StoreVirtual VSA has a maximum limit of 50TB per node, and hence the total amount of the configured storage on the StoreVirtual system should not exceed 50 TB.

#### Enrolling the New Baremetal Server {#enroll-new-baremetal-server}

To deploy HP StoreVirtual VSA, perform the following:

1. SSH to undercloud as heat-admin from seed.

		# ssh heat-admin@<IP Address>
		# sudo -i
		# source stackrc

	**Note:** Before enrolling the new Baremetal server for StoreVirtual deployment, ensure that `ironic node-list` in the undercloud server does not have any free nodes suitable for StoreVirtual installation. If a suitable node is available, skip the Baremetal registration steps and go to **step 5** below.

2. Register the new Baremetal server in the Ironic database. Replace the cpus, memory&#095;mb,local&#095;gb,ipmi&#095;address, ipmi&#095;password variable values with your Baremetal settings. 

		# ironic node-create -d pxe_ipmitool -p cpus=<value> -p memory_mb=<value> -p local_gb=<value> -p cpu_arch=<value> -i ipmi_address=<IP Address> -i ipmi_username=<username> -i ipmi_password=<password>

	Following is the example for reference:

		# ironic node-create -d pxe_ipmitool -p cpus=12 -p memory_mb=98304 -p local_gb=1800 -p cpu_arch=amd64 -i ipmi_address=10.12.22.70 -i ipmi_username=admin -i ipmi_password=password

3. Create the ironic port for the ironic node that you created in the  previous step.
 
		# ironic port-create --address $MAC_ADDR --node_uuid $NODE_UUID

	**$MAC_ADDR** refers to the MAC Address of the Baremetal server.

4. List the Baremetal nodes. This command also lists the newly added nodes.

		# ironic node-list

5. Log out from the undercloud to go back to the seed.

6. Edit the `/root/baremetal.csv file` in seed cloud with the details of the newly added node. <!---7. Edit the `/root/tripleo/configs/kvm-custom-ips.json` and update the value for `vsa_scale` or `vsa_ao_scale` appropriately.-->

7. Edit the environment variables file used during initial installation and update the value for `vsa_scale` or `vsa_ao_scale` appropriately

       	vsa_scale: <no of StoreVirtual systems>

		vsa_ao_scale: <no of StoreVirtual systems with AO enabled>

	
	**NOTE**: For HP StoreVirtual VSA, a management group with two storage systems and a Failover Manager is the minimum configuration for automated fault tolerant operations. Configurations greater than two systems can be redundant and do not require a Failover Manager. The Failover Manager is a specialized version of the LeftHand OS software designed to operate as a manager and provide automated failover capability. It runs as a virtual appliance and must be installed on a separate system/VM  other than the storage systems in the SAN.

8. Execute the environment variables <!---`kvm-custom-ips.json`--> file using the source command

		# source tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_load_config.sh tripleo/configs/<environment variables file name> 

	for example 

		# source tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_load_config.sh tripleo/configs/kvm-custom-ips.json 

	<!---**Note**: Source the same file (`kvm-default.json` or `kvm-custom-ips.json`) that is used during the initial installation for specifying the environment IPs.9. Run the installer script to update the overcloud. During the installation, the number of StoreVirtual storage systems that you specified in the `overcloud-config.json`, are deployed.-->
9. Run the installer script to update the overcloud. During the installation, the number of StoreVirtual storage systems that you specified in the environment variables file are deployed. 

 	 	# bash -x /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh --update-overcloud |& tee update.log

##Verifying StoreVirtual installation status {#verify-install}

To verify that the StoreVirtual storage system is deployed successfully, perform the following checks:

1. Log in to the undercloud from seed.


		# ssh heat-admin@<undercloud IP address>

 		 
2. Source stackrc file and list the deployed StoreVirtual nodes.

		# source stackrc 
		# heat stack-list
		# nova list|grep vsa

3. Log in to the StoreVirtual system from the seed using the IP address retrieved 
from the above steps.

		# ssh heat-admin@<StoreVirtual system IP Address>

4. Check the log files.

		# tailf /installer.log

	The message "*Started VM vsa-hostname*" indicates the successful installation of StoreVirtual on the machine.The IP Address of the StoreVirtual storage system can be retrieved from this log file.

5. To display the status of all the StoreVirtual VMs.

		# virsh list --all 

	To get more details on the installer logs, check the `/var/log/storevirtual-installer.log` file.

6. On successful installation of StoreVirtual VM on Baremetal, go to the Centralized Management Console(CMC) and discover the storage systems.
