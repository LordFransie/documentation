# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.0: Distributed Virtual Routing (DVR) Overview
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.1 version of this page](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/dvr/overview/)

Distributed Virtual Routing (DVR) allows you to define connectivity among different VNSs as well as connectivity between VNS hosts and the external network. HP Helion OpenStack provides Distributed Virtual Routing to cloud users.  

Distributed virtual routing is achieved through a set of distributed virtual routers. Each tenant has its own distributed virtual router to define the connectivity among the VNSs under the same tenant. 


A distributed virtual router is conceptually a single entity, but it is implemented across all the OpenFlow switches in the network. There is no single routing instance running on a single machine/hypervisor that all the VNS traffic must route through. In addition to this, there is a system-wide distributed virtual router which connects different tenant routers and defines the connectivity among different tenants and to the outside world. 

For more details, refer to [OpenStack Neutron/DVR](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/DVR/HowTo).


<!---To configure and enable the DVR, modify the following files:



<**WHERE WILL THESE FILES BE LOCATED??? WHAT ARE THE SET OF COMMANDS THAT WILL TAKE THE USER TO THE LOCATION AND START EDIT PROCESS???? APART FROM THIS WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO ADD?????**>



***<ml2_conf.ini>***

  This flag is enabled for the L2 Agent to address DVR rules.
	

	enable_distributed_routing = True


***<l3_agent.ini>***

Define the working mode for the agent. Allowed values are: **legacy**, **dvr**, **dvr_snat**.


<**PLEASE GIVE ME THE EXPLANATION OF EACH OF THE ABOVE VALUES AND WHEN THEY ARE USED?????**>

The same l3-agent source runs on Compute nodes, Network nodes and Service nodes with different configurations.

	agent_mode = dvr
	

***<neutron.conf>***

To enable distributed routing this flag is enabled. It can be either **True** or **False**. If **False** is chosen, it works in the *Legacy mode*. If **True** is chosen, it works in the *DVR mode*.

	router_distributed = True

This is disabled by default.

**Note**: Only Cloud Administrators can deploy or set the default router types (**Legacy**, **Centralized** or **Distributed**). User cannot control the type of routers that are created.-->
