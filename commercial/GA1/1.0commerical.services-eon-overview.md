# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.0: EON Service Overview #
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.1 version of this page](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/eon/overview/)

ESX integration in HP Helion OpenStack enables administrators to connect their cloud to an existing VMware vCenter installation. The VMware vCenter driver connects to ESXi clusters in a vCenter through Compute proxy nodes. The Nova scheduler sees the ESXi clusters as compute nodes and uses that information for scheduling a new instance. 

The ESX on border (EON) service is an inventory which interacts with the VMware vCenter server and collects the information available at the datacenters and clusters. This information is used for deployment and configuration of ESX Proxy Compute nodes. The EON service is deployed in the undercloud controller node. 

EON, a new service sub component, captures details of the vCenter server in a Cloud Controller and provides the details of the clusters for configuring the list of clusters managed by ESX Proxy Compute node. The ESX Proxy Compute driver communicates to VMware vCenter server through VI SDK. 


<!--
*  A RESTful API service

* A Conductor service <!--, which does the bulk of the work of interacting with VMWare vCenter Server, collects and monitors the inventory of Datacenters, Clusters and vSwitch / dvSwitch details and makes it available to other services through REST APIs-->
<!--
* A Database and DB API <!--for storing the list of managed vCenter Servers and its associated Datacenter vSwitch / dvSwitch,  activated / imported Clusters details-->
<!--
* The message bus is used to communicate between eon-api and eon-conductor.

## Working with the EON Service

To perform tasks using the EON service, you can use the dashboard or CLI.

### Using the dashboards<a name="UI"></a>

You can use the [HP Helion OpenStack Dashboard](/helion/openstack/undercloud/resource/esx/compute/) to work with the EON service.

###Using the CLI<a name="cli"></a>

You can use the command-line interface software to access HP EON service. See [Command Line Interface-EON](/helion/openstack/undercloud/eon/cli/)
