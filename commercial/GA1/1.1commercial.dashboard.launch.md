# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Logging into the Helion Dashboards
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/dashboard/login/)

1. Ask the cloud operator for the host name or public IP address where the dashboard is located, your user name, and your password.

2. Open a web browser that has both JavaScript and cookies enabled.

3. In the address bar, enter the host name or IP address for the dashboard.

	**Note:** If a certificate warning appears when you try to access the URL for the first time, a self-signed certificate is in use. These certificates are not considered trustworthy by default. Verify the certificate or add an exception in the browser to bypass the warning.

4. On the **Log In** page, enter your user name and password and then click **Sign In**.
