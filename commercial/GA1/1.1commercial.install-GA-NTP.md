# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Installing an NTP Server
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/install/ntp/)

This page provides detailed information on configuring the seed VM as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. NTP is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems. The undercloud and overcloud systems are configured as NTP clients during the installation process.

HP Helion OpenStack does not require that you use the seed VM as the NTP server. You can use an external NTP server, as needed.

**Notes:** 

* NTP clients should use only stratum 2 and higher servers (meaning stratum 1 or stratum 0).
* All the Helion servers use UTC as a time zone.

##Configure NTP

To configure an NTP server, follow these steps: 

1. Install the NTP package using the following command:

		sudo apt-get install ntp

3. Add NTP servers to `/etc/ntp.conf`. The following example use servers from the NTP Pool Project:

	server ntp.ubuntu.com

	**Note:** The NTP stratum must be 10 or higher (meaning stratum 9, stratum 8, etc.) in order to use as a source. If one is not available, you may be able to [fudge one](#fudge).

4. Configure system time zone using the `tzselect` command.

	a. Change to the /usr/bin/` directory.

	b. Execute the `tzselect` command. The available time zones are listed.

	c. Select from the listed time zones by entering a number at the promnpt.

	The output should be placed in `/etc/profile` and executed on the command line

5. Verify that your server is broadcasting using the `ntpq -p` command. You should see a message similar to the following: 

		ntpq -p
		remote 	refid 	st	t	when	poll	reach	delay	offset	jitter
		==============================================================================
		*ops-ae1ops-ntp0	209.51.161.238	2	u	242	1024	377	0.509	0.043	0.206
		LOCAL(0)	.LOCL.	10	l	76h	64	0	0.000	0.000	0.000

	You can now point clients to your NTP server

6. Add your NTP server IP to the clients `/etc/ntp.conf` file

7. Configure the system time zone.

		/usr/bin/tzselect

	The output should be placed in `/etc/profile` and executed on the command line

8. Restart the NTP service.

		service ntp restart

9. Verify that you have a connection to the NTP server.

		ntpq -pd

10. Verify that your server shows client connections.

		ntpdc -c monlist

## Troubleshooting ##

### Trouble synching ###

If your client (including your NTP server) has trouble syncing time, you can try the following.

1. Sync system time with system clock.

		hwclock [--utc | --localtime] -s --hctosys (update system time based on hardware clock)
		hwclock [--utc | --localtime] -w --systohc (update hardware clock based on system time)
		hwclock [--utc | --localtime] --systz (update system time based on timezone)

2. Verify hardware clock time.

		hwclock -r

3. Verify system time.

		date

4. If the times are still not synchronizing, check if the NTP ports are blocked.

		sudo apt-get install nmap

		sudo nmap -p123 -sU -P0 <localhost | known ntp host>

###Stratum lower than 10<a name="fudge"></a>

NTP uses a hierarchical, semi-layered system of time sources. Each level of this hierarchy is termed a *stratum* and is assigned a number starting with zero at the top. The number represents the distance from the reference clock and is used to prevent cyclical dependencies in the hierarchy. 

HP Helion OpenStack uses stratum 10. Using a numerically high stratum ensures that this is only used if all external clocks fail. This will mitigate skew until external clocks return to service.

If your NTP stratum is lower than 10, set up your host as the time source by fudging a stratum 10.

1. Configure host as a time source.

2. Add the following to /etc/ntp.conf to force a stratum 10.

		server 127.127.1.0
		fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10

3. Restart the NTP service

		service ntp restart



Using fudge to say that the local clock is stratum 10 makes ntp use the local clock when no timeservers are available. This is good because it makes sure you can disconnect your box from the Internet without getting your clock screwed.
