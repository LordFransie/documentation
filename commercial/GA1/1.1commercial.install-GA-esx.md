# HP Helion OpenStack&reg; 1.1: Installation and Configuration for ESX Hypervisor

HP Helion OpenStack allows you to manage the ESX hypervisor, manage the VMware vCenter, and provision virtual machines. This document provides installation instructions for HP Helion OpenStack on a suitably specified and prepared system.

## Installing HP Helion OpenStack<a name="install"></a>

The installation and configuration process for ESX consists of the following general steps:

* Verify Prerequisites
	* Edit the JSON environment variables file
	* Prepare baremetal.csv file
	* Set DNS servers
	* Preparing seed cloud host to run seed VM
* Download and extracting the installation packages
* Installing HP Helion OpenStack
   * Configure proxy information
   * Install the seed VM and building your cloud
* Verifying the installation
* Create projects for LDAP users
* Next steps

## Preparing for installation {#prepare}

Before starting the installation, review the following sections.

### Verify Prerequisites {#pre}

To ensure successful installation, [perform required pre-installation tasks](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/prereqs/) before you start.


## Installing HP Helion OpenStack {#install}

Make sure you have met all the hardware requirements and have completed the required tasks before you begin your installation. The following sections walk you through the steps to be executed on the seed cloud host:

* [Configure proxy information](#proxy)
* [Installing the seed VM and building your cloud](#startseed)



### Install the seed VM and build your cloud {#startseed}

1. Make sure you are logged into the seed cloud host as root. If not:
 
		sudo su -

2. Execute the `esx-custom-ips.json` file using the `source` command. The `source` command executes the content of the file passed as argument, in the current shell.

		source tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_load_config.sh tripleo/configs/esx-custom-ips.json

3. Start the seed VM installation by entering the following command:

		bash -x /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_host_manager.sh --create-seed

	**Note**:The installation process takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The output will be recorded in a file named *seedinstall.log*.

	When the seed VM startup is complete, you should see a message similar to the following:

		"Wed OCt 23 11:25:10 IST 2014 --- completed setup seed" 

	**Note:** If `hp_ced_host_manager.sh` fails to start the seed, restart the installation (step 1) and then follow the rest of the steps.

3. To build the cloud, start by logging in to the seed VM. Run the following command from `/root` using the IP address of seed VM as defined in the `esx-custom_ips.json` environment variables file:

		ssh root@<seed_VM_IP_address>

	**Note**: It might take a few moments for the seed VM to become reachable. 

4. When prompted for host authentication, type `yes` to allow the SSH connection to proceed.

	The prompt will change to `root@hLinux`.

5. Make sure the information in the [`baremetal.csv` configuration file](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/prereqs/#req-info) file is correct and upload the file to `/root`.

	**Note:** For more information on creating this file, refer to [Creating the baremetal.csv file](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/prereqs/#req-info) on the *Prerequisites* page.

6. If you are integrating LDAP into your environment, copy the configuration files, as described in [Integrating LDAP](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/identity/integrate-ldap/), to the seed cloud host.

	a. Copy the `overcloud_keystone_ldap.json` file to the `/root/tripleo/hp_passthrough` folder:

		scp overcloud_keystone_ldap.json root@<seed_VM_IP_address>:/root/tripleo/hp_passthrough/overcloud_keystone_ldap.json

	b. Place overcloud-env.json file (if created) into `/root/tripleo` folder.

		scp overcloud-env.json root@<seed_VM_IP_address>:/root/tripleo/overcloud-env.json


7. **[Optional]** Use IPMItool to verify that network connectivity from the seed VM to the baremetal servers in your `baremetal.csv` is working.

8. Use the IPMItool to manually power off each baremetal system specified in your `baremetal.csv` before proceeding with the installation. 
    
	**IMPORTANT:** Make sure that each system is configured in the BIOS to stay powered off in the event of being shut down rather than automatically restarting.

14. Execute the `esx-custom-ips.json` file for the undercloud and overcloud nodes using the `source` command. The `source` command executes the content of the file passed as argument, in the current shell.

		source tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_load_config.sh tripleo/configs/esx-custom-ips.json 

9. Install and configure the undercloud and overcloud by running the following command from /root. 

		bash -x /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh |& tee cloud_install.log 

	Output messages will indicate when the undercloud and overcloud controllers become active, services are created and configured, and other aspects of the installation are executed. 

10. When the deployment completes, a message displays asking you to submit information on the install to HP. Enter Y to submit or any other key to not submit.

	If your installation is successful, a message similar to the following is displayed:
 
		"HP - completed - Tue Oct 23 16:20:20 UTC 2014"

	**Note:** If the installation does not complete properly, refer to the [Troubleshooting](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/troubleshooting/) document.

If possible, leave this console display open as you will need the passwords to verify the installation. 

## Verify your installation {#verifying-your-installation}

To verify that the installation is successful, connect to the HP Helion OpenStack dashboard and the undercloud dashboard as shown in [Verifying your installation](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/verify/).

<!-- Not needed in 1.1
## Create projects for LDAP users {#ldap}

If you are integrating LDAP into your environment, you need to configure the Horizon dashboard for users. For more information, see *Configure Horizon* on the [Integrating LDAP page](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/identity/integrate-ldap/#horizon).
