# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Deploying and Configuring OVSvApp on ESX hosts  

[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/install/ovsvapp/)

HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) is an enhanced Networking Operations (Neutron) service module of HP Helion OpenStack that delivers network virtualization to orchestrate your data center infrastructure.

The HP Virtual Cloud Networking Open vSwitch vApp (OVSvApp) appliance must be installed on each ESX hypervisor in the HP Helion OpenStack environment to provision VMs in your VMware vCenter environment. Once deployed, the OVSvApp enables networking between the tenant Virtual Machines (VMs).

The deployment process includes the following basic steps:

1. Uploading the OVSvApp file to one of the ESX hosts in your data center.
2. Adding your settings to the configuration file so that the OVSvApp deployment script can clone the file on each host being managed by the overcloud controller.
3. Running the deployment script.

The following topics in this section explain how to deploy and verify deployment of OVSvApp for VCN on ESX hosts.

* [Prerequisites](#prereqs)
* [Deploying the OVSvApp](#deploytemplate)
* [Verifying your deployment](#deploymentverification)
* [Managing the HP VCN networking service](#managevcnnetworkservice)
* [Cleaning up or deleting the OVSvApp](#clean)
* [Update OVSvApp](#update)
* [Next Steps](#next)

If you are having issues with the installation or operation of the OVSvApp, see [Troubleshooting](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/troubleshooting/ovsvapp/)

## Prerequisites {#prereqs}

Before you install the OVSvApp, ensure the following:

- The HP Helion OpenStack must be installed and configured.

- The VMware vSphere&#174; platform must be installed and configured.

- The vCenter server must be reachable from the server where OVSvApp VM installation is launched. 

- Unset the `https_proxy` environment variable on the server where OVSvApp VM deployment will be launched, using the following command:

	unset https_proxy

- Configure one of the following options to configure DVS: 
	- **Automatic DVS configuration:** If the `auto_dvs` value in the `ovs_vapp.ini` file is set to true, the VDS will be configured during the deployment. Automatic configuration requires ESX 5.1 or greater. To consume this functionality,in addition to the data VLANs in the uplink, the ESX management VLAN should also be allowed. If an existing ESX management network is in a different uplink, the new L2 network should be created for the ESX compute proxy and ovsvapp VM consumption.
		
	- **Manual DVS configuration:** If the `auto_dvs` value in the `ovs_vapp.ini` file is set to false, you need to create and configure the VDS as given below. Manual configuration requires ESX 5.0.0 or greater.

		There must be two Virtual Distributed Switches (VDS) and they are configured as follows: 

    	**VDS1**: This switch has no uplink ports configured and has a portgroup of type **VLAN** with **Trunking enabled**. The portgroup must contain the list of VLAN tags that are used by overcloud Networking Operations (Neutron) service. The **Promiscuous Mode** and **Forged Transmits** options must be set to **Accept** under the **Security** tab for the **Portgroup**.	

    	**Note**: The name of VLAN trunk portgroup must be associated with `trunk_port_name` parameter in the `ovs_vapp.ini`. You will create the INI file in [Modify and execute the installer](#modify).
    
		**VDS2**: This switch should have an uplink port connecting to the overcloud baremetal network. Two portgroups should be available for this switch - management, data.  Management portgroup handles the management traffic and may or may not be not configured for VLAN. 

		The data portgroup should be of type VLAN with `Trunking enabled`. It should contain the list of VLAN tags that are used by overcloud Networking Operations service. The **Promiscuous Mode** and **Forged Transmits** options should be set to **Accept** under the **Security** tab for the data portgroup.
		
		**Note**: You will need this information for a configuration file, `ovs_vapp.ini`. The management portgroup must be associated with `mgmt_port_name` parameter and the data portgroup must be associated with `data_port_name` parameter in the `ovs_vapp.ini`. You will create the INI file in [Modify and execute the installer](#modify).

	Example:

		VDS1  - trunk portgroup name - vlan_trunk
		VDS2 
			a. Portgroup1 name - mgmt
			b. Portgroup2 name - data

		Changes in ovs_vapp.ini for the above values
		
		[network]
	
		trunk_port_name=vlan_trunk
		data_port_name=data
		mgmt_port_name=mgmt

	Use the following diagram for reference:

### Notes for deploying OVSvApp VM onto ESX hypervisors ### {#esx}

* The ESX version required depends upon how VDS is deployed, as described in [Prerequisites](#prereqs}.

* Please make sure that ESX host does not have another iteration of the OVSvApp already deployed. 

* The ESX host must be reachable from the server where OVSvApp VM installation is launched. The ipaddress of the ESX hosts should be the same ipaddress with which the vCenter server manages that host. For more information see [Preparing the network for an ESX installation](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/prereqs/#network_prepare) in *Prerequisites*. 

- All ESX hosts must have synchronized time settings. If hosts have different time, the deployment will fail.

- Use the vShpere client to select **Disable: Allow VM power on operations that violate availability constraints** as a part of cluster settings, as shaown. If not, ESX host might hang at 2% during transition to maintenance mode. 

	<img src="media/OVSvApp_all_vm_power.png">

- 	If VDS will be configured automatically (`auto_dvs = True`) the installer requires one physical NIC name as input. This physical NIC must be unused(not part of any VSS or VDS) and its name should be same across all ESX hosts within a datacenter. 

- The traffic between two tenant VMs on the same network and on the same ESX Compute host cannot be blocked. If custom security groups are used, add explicit security group rules to allow traffic between the VMs, regardless of the compute host they are provisioned on. Using rules to allow traffic will help maintain VM connectivity.



## Deploy the OVSvApp ## {#deploytemplate}

You must upload the OVSvApp appliance to one of the ESX hosts that is hosting VMs provisioned from HP Helion OpenStack environment. You must then configure the settings in the configuration file. The file can be used to clone and deploy OVSvApp on each host being managed by the controller.

The deploy process installs the OVSvApp as a virtual machine, which is referred to as *OVSvApp VM* in this document.

**Notes**

* The OVSvApp VMs must be installed on each ESX hypervisor. 
* IP address are assigned to the OVSvApp VMs manually. The Administrator must keep a separate pool of IP addresses from the management VLAN to be assigned to the OVSvApp VMs. These IP addresses must be assigned to the Ethernet interfaces connecting to the management port group.
* If `auto_dvs` is set to `True`, the OVSvApp VM management port group must be different than the Compute proxy management port group.
* Specify distributed virtual switch (VDS) ports in the `ovs_vapp.ini`. Make sure the VDS ports are attached with the proper hosts.

The deploy process installs the OVSvApp as a virtual machine, which is referred to as *OVSvApp VM* in this document.

* [Create a VM template in vCenter](#createtemp)
* [Install the prerequisite python libraries](#python)
* [Modify and execute the installer](#modify)

### Create a VM template in vCenter {#createtemp}

The first step in deploying the OVSvApp is to create a VM template that will make it easier to deploy the OVSvApp on each ESX hypervisor.

To deploy the OVSvApp:

1. Create a directory `/ovsvapp` on any server in the Helion environment and upload `ovsvapp-1.1.tgz`. Extract the `ovsvapp_1.1.tgz` and locate  `overcloud_esx_ovsvapp.ova`. This is the OVSvApp appliance.

2. Use the vSphere client to upload the `overcloud_esx_ovsvapp.ova` file to one of the ESX hosts in your data center: 

	a. In the vSphere Client, click **File > Deploy OVF Template**.

	b. Follow the instructions in the wizard that displays to specify the data center, cluster, and node to install onto. Refer to the VMWare vSphere documentation, as needed.

	The installer creates the OVSvApp appliance (VM) on the specified node. The appliance is listed in the left column of vCenter, by default named `overcloud-esx-ovsvapp-(time-stamp)`.

	<!-- Remove per DOCS-1027

	3. Add a **CD-ROM** device to the OVSvApp appliance using the vCenter. 

	a. In the vSphere Client, right-click the OVSvApp appliance.

	b. Click **Edit Settings**.	

	c. Select the **Hardware** tab and click **Add**.

	d. Select **DVD/CD-ROM Drive**.

	e. Follow the instructions in the wizard that displays.

	Refer to the VMWare vSphere documentation, as needed.

	4. Enable the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI), a high-speed communication channel between a virtual machine and the ESX hypervisor.

	a. On the **Hardware** tab, select **Enable VMCI Between VMs**. The **Hardware** tab should be open from the previous step.

	b. Click **OK**.

	5. Power on the OVSvApp appliance using vCenter. The default credentials to login to the OVSvApp appliance are `stack/stack`. 

	6. Install the VMWare tools in the OVSvApp appliance: 
	
	a.In the vSphere Client, right-click the OVSvApp appliance.

	b. Select **Guest > Install/Upgrade VMware Tools**. 

	7. Launch the OVSvApp appliance console to install the VMware Tools from command line terminal: 

	a. Right-click the OVSvApp appliance and select **Open Console**.

	b. Enter the following commands:

		sudo su
		mkdir /mnt/vmware-tools
		mount /dev/cdrom/ /mnt/vmware-tools
		cp -f /mnt/vmware-tools/VMwareTools-*.tar.gz /tmp/
		cd /tmp
		tar -zxpf VMwareTools-*.tar.gz
		cd vmware-tools-distrib/
		./vmware-install.pl -??-default

	Verify that VMWare Tools is running using the following command: 

		service vmware-tools status

	Do not proceed with the installation if VMWare Tools is not running.


	8. When the installation completes, shutdown the OVSvApp appliance.

	9. Disable the VMCI: 

	a. Right-click the OVSvApp appliance. 

	b.  Click **Edit Settings**.	

	c. Remove the CD/DVD drive.

	d. Clear the **Enable VMCI between VMs** option.

	 -->

10. Convert that OVSvApp appliance to template format. 

	a. Right-click the OVSvApp appliance.

	b. Click **Template > Convert to Template**.

	vCenter Server marks that virtual machine as a template and displays the task in the Recent Tasks pane.

## Clean up or deleting the OVSvApp {#clean}

To clean up or delete the OVSvAPP setup:

1. On the server where you extracted the `ee_installer.tgz` locate the `ovs_vapp.ini` under `tripleo/hp-ovsvapp/conf`.

2. Modify the `ovs_vapp.ini` file by entering only the connection details in the [vmware] section.

	Note: You do not need to specify the `Clusters on which OVSvApp will be hosted` value.

3. Run the following commands and follow the instructions:

		cd tripleo/hp-ovsvapp/src/cleanup
		python cleanup.py

	The installer presents 

4. Select an option:

		1. Delete all OVSvApps from a Datacenter
		2. Delete all OVSvApps with Trunk and Uplink VDS from a Datacenter
		3. Delete all OVSvApps from given Clusters
		4. Delete a single or a comma separated list of OVSvApp

	**Notes**
	-For all the options, you have to fill the connection details which is the [vmware] section(Except clusters) of ovs_vapp.ini 
	-For option 2, along with connection details you have to provide the uplink and trunk VDS/DVS name in [network] section of ovs_vapp.ini 
	-For option 3 you have to fill the clusters field in the [vmware] section of ovs_vapp.ini 
	-For option 4 you have to provide a single OVSvAPP name or a comma separated list of names


## Update OVSvApp {#update}

The update can be run only from the system where OVSvAPP passwordless authentication is enabled. That is, from the system where id_rsa key is present for the public key (id_rsa.pub) that was used during OVSvAPP 1.0 installation.

To update the OVSvApp from version 1.01 to version 1.1:

1. Install the fabric python library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fabric) using the following command: 

		pip install fabric 

2. Download the `ovsvapp-patch-*.zip` and extract the files. 

	The download has `hp-ovsvapp` directory and `ovsvapp-patch-*.tar.gz` 

3. Edit the `ovs_vapp.ini` file in the downloaded `hp-ovsvapp` directory: 

	a. Enter the path to the SSH key file in the [vmconfig] section. 

	Use the same ssh key (id_rsa.pub) that was used for OVSvAPP 1.0 installation.

	b. Enter the path to the `ovsvapp-patch-*.tar.gz` file in the `update_file_path` value in the [update] section.

	c. If you want to be able to roll back the update to the previous version, set the `do_backup` value in the [update] section to `True`.

		do_backup=True

	d. Enter the starting name/prefix of `OVSvAPP` in the `ovsvapp_prefix=` if your existing OVSvAPP version is v1.0. Keep blank if your existing OVSvAPP is 1.01 or higher. 

	e. Provide the Kibana Rabbit Host address and password in the [logger] section. 

4. Edit the `neutron.conf` file to disable Maintenance Mode for the OVSvApp.

		enable_agent_monitor=False

5. Execute the following command to execute the change to the `neutron.conf` file:

		update_overcloud

4. Execute the following commands: 

		sudo su 
		cd /hp-ovsvapp/src/update #python updater.py

**Note:** If you see the following error while updating the OVSvApp, it means that the system from where update is launched does not have the passwordless authentication enabled for OVSvAPPs. 

    Fatal error: Needed to prompt for a connection or sudo password (host: <ovs-vapp-ip>), but input would be ambiguous in parallel mode
    Aborting.
