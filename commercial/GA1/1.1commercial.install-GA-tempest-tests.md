# HP Helion OpenStack&reg; 1.1: Verifying the Install Using Embedded Tests

A version of the upstream [Tempest](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tempest/) integration tests  is pre-deployed in the undercloud. 

To run Tempest, edit the Tempest configuration file that is included in the installation package. The configuration file describes where to find the various services and other testing behavior switches.

You can use these embedded tests to verify if the deployed overcloud is functional.

## Running the tests ## {#running}

To run the default set of Tempest tests:

1. Login to the seed VM. 

2. SSH into the undercloud node:

		ssh heat-admin@${UNDERCLOUD_IP}
		sudo -i

3. Source the overcloud admin credentials, activate the virtual environment and start the tests:

		source ~root/overcloud.stackrc
		source /opt/stack/venvs/openstack/bin/activate
		run-tempest

Optionally, you can [customize Tempest to run specific tests](#custom). 

## Test results ## {#results}

Tempest is deployed under `/opt/stack/tempest`. During a test run, test results are displayed on the console. A detailed log file is written to `/opt/stack/tempest/tempest.log`.

The results are also stored in the `testrespository` database. 

To access the results after the run:

1. Login to the seed VM. 

2. SSH into the undercloud node:

		ssh heat-admin@${UNDERCLOUD_IP}
		sudo -i

3. Change to the `tempest` directory and list test results:

		cd /opt/stack/tempest
		testr last

See [Test Repository users manual](https://testrepository.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for more details on how to manage the test result repository.

## Customizing the test run ## {#custom}

There are several ways available to customize which tests will be executed.

* [Run tests for a specific service](#service)
* [Run tests matching a series of white and blacklists](#list)
* [Run tests against all APIs](#API)
* [Exclude all admin and negative tests](#exclude)
* [Exclude CLI and third party tests](#third)
* [Run tests for specific services and exclude specific features](#services)

### Run tests for a specific service {#service} 

You can run only tests against a specific service, such as  Compute, Networking, or Identity.

1. Login to the seed VM. 

2. SSH into the undercloud node:

		ssh heat-admin@${UNDERCLOUD_IP}
		sudo -i

3. Execute the following command:

		OS_TESTPATH=./tempest/api/{service} run-tempest

	Where `{service}` is the name of the service, such as `compute`, `identity`, or `network`.

### Run tests matching a series of white and blacklists {#list} 

You can run tests against specific scenarios by editing the tests2skip.txt file. 

Whitelist is applied first. The blacklist is executed against the set of tests returned by the whitelist.

* If whitelist is empty, all available tests are fed to blacklist.
* If blacklist is empty, all tests from whitelist are returned.

Documentation on the format of white and black-lists is available at http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/tripleo-image-elements/tree/elements/tempest/tests2skip.py#n24. 

- lines starting with # or empty are ignored
- lines starting with "+" are whitelisted
- lines starting with "-" are blacklisted
- lines not matching any of the above conditions are blacklisted



The following entries run API tests, exclude tests that are less relevant for deployment validation, such as negative, admin, cli and thirdparty (EC2) tests:

		+tempest\.api\.*
		*[Aa]dmin.*
		*[Nn]egative.*
		- tempest\.cli.*
		- tempest\.thirdparty\.*

Exclude all admin and negative tests {#exclude}

		*[Aa]dmin.*
		*[Nn]egative.*
		- tempest\.cli.*
		- tempest\.thirdparty\.*


Exclude CLI and third party tests {#third}


### Run tests for specific services and exclude specific features {#services}

Tempest allow you to test specific services and features using `tempest.conf.sample` configuration file, `tempest.conf.sample`. 

A sample configuration file with inline documentation is deployed under `/opt/stack/tempest/etc/tempest.conf.sample`.

See the `service_available` section to enable or disable tests which require a specific service. 

See the `*_feature_enabled` sections to enable or  disabled tests which require a specific feature of a specific service. 

## Known issues ## {#issues}

The following failing tests can be excluded from the test run by adding the following to the `tests2skip.txt file`:

### Exclude tests for features non available or test not compatible

* tempest\.api\.compute\.certificates\.*
* tempest\.api\.compute\.servers.test_disk_config\.*
* tempest\.api\.network\.test_fwaas_extensions\.*
* tempest\.api\.network\.test_vpnaas_extensions\.*
* tempest\.api\.network\.test_load_balancer\.*
* tempest\.api\.image\.v1\.test_image\.CreateRegisterImagesTest\.test_register_http_image
* tempest\.api\.image\.v1\.test_images\.CreateRegisterImagesTest\.test_register_remote_image
* tempest.api\.network\.test_metering_extensions\.MeteringTestJSON
* tempest\.api\.network\.test_metering_extensions\.MeteringIpV6TestJSON

* tempest\.api\.compute\.floating_ips\.test_list_floating_ips\.FloatingIPDetailsTestJSON\.test_list_floating_ip_pools

## Known failures ## {#fail}

The following known failures can be fixed by installing the `tempest-lib>=0.2.0` OpenStack Functional Testing Library.

See [tempest-lib 0.2.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tempest-lib/0.2.0) for information on downloading the library.

## Disclaimer ## {#disclaimer}

Running the tests requires access the overcloud identity admin credentials; it will create and delete test accounts and test resources for test purposes. 

In certain cases tempest may fail to clean-up some of test resources after a test is complete, for example in case of failed tests.
