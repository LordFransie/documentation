# HP Helion OpenStack&reg; 1.1 Verifying your installation
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/install/verify/)

Once your installation is complete, you should make sure you can connect to your HP Helion OpenStack cloud. You can accomplish this in any of the following ways:

* [Connecting to the undercloud Horizon console](#connectunder)
* [Connecting to the overcloud Horizon console](#connectover)
* [Connecting to demo VM](#connectvm)
* [Connecting to the monitoring and logging interfaces](#connectmonitor)

### Connecting to the undercloud Horizon console ### {#connectunder}

From the seed cloud host, connect to the undercloud Horizon console.

1. Obtain the passwords for the `demo` and `admin` users 

	`cat /root/tripleo/tripleo-overcloud-passwords`

2. Point your web browser on the seed cloud host to the undercloud Horizon console using the `UNDERCLOUD_IP_ADDRESS` obtained after the install.

	If you did not retrieve the undercloud IP from the end of the install, enter the following command:

		. /root/tripleo/tripleo-undercloud-passwords
		TE_DATAFILE=/root/tripleo/ce_env.json . /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/undercloudrc
		OVERCLOUD_IP=$(heat output-show overcloud KeystoneURL | cut -d: -f2 | sed s,/,,g )
		echo $UNDERCLOUD_IP

4. Log in as `demo` or `admin` using the corresponding passwords obtained in step 1.

5. In the Horizon console, you can obtain the IP address of the demo VM:

	a. **Click Project > Compute > Instance**.

	b. Note the public IP address of the `demo` instance, starting with `192`.

### Connecting to the overcloud Horizon console ### {#connectover}

From the seed cloud host, connect to the overcloud Horizon console.

1. Obtain the passwords for the `demo` and `admin` users 

	`cat /root/tripleo/tripleo-overcloud-passwords`

2. Point your web browser on the seed cloud host to the overcloud Horizon console using the `OVERCLOUD_IP_ADDRESS` obtained after the install.

	If you did not retrieve the overcloud IP from the end of the install, enter the following command:

		. /root/tripleo/tripleo-undercloud-passwords
		TE_DATAFILE=/root/tripleo/ce_env.json . /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/undercloudrc
		OVERCLOUD_IP=$(heat output-show overcloud KeystoneURL | cut -d: -f2 | sed s,/,,g )
		echo $OVERCLOUD_IP

4. Log in as `demo` or `admin` using the corresponding passwords obtained in step 1.

5. In the Horizon console, you can obtain the IP address of the demo VM:

	a. Click **Project > Compute > Instance**.

	b. Note the public IP address of the `demo` instance, starting with `192`.


### Connecting to the demo VM ### {#connectvm}

From the seed cloud host, you can connect to the demo VM using the following steps:

<!-- Maybe not needed per Chris Cannon
1. Export the overcloud passwords:

	`. /root/tripleo/tripleo-overcloud-passwords`

2. Export the overcloud users:

	`TE_DATAFILE=/root/tripleo/ce_env.json . /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/overcloudrc-user`

3. Verify you can view the nova instances:

	`nova list`

4. Assign the demo VM IP address to a variable:

	`DEMO_IP=$(nova list | grep " demo " | awk ' { print $13 } ')`
-->

1. Connect to the demo VM using the IP address you obtained from the Horizon console:

	`ssh debian@${DEMO_IP}`

	**Note:** It might take a few minutes for the demo vm to become available using ssh after finishing the installation.

	If the prompt changes to `debian@demo`, you have successfully connected to the demo VM.

2. Before proceeding, enter `exit` to disconnect from the demo VM.

### Connecting to the monitoring and logging interfaces ### {#connectmonitor}

HP Helion OpenStack includes monitoring logging. The monitoring service uses [Icinga](/helion/community/services/icinga/) interface and the logging service uses the Kibana interface. 


You can access these services with the following steps:

1. To access the Icinga monitoring console, launch a web browser on the seed cloud host to the following IP address, using the undercloud IP address from the end of the install:

		http://<undercloud IP>/icinga/

	**Example:**

		http://192.0.2.2/icinga

2. Log in with the user name `icingaadmin` and password `icingaadmin`.

4. To access the Kibana logging console, launch a web browser on the seed cloud host to the following IP address, using the undercloud IP address from the end of the install:

		http://<undercloud IP>:81 

	**Example:**

		http://192.0.2.2:81

5. Log in with the user name `kibana` and the password you obtained from the end of the install.

	If you did not retrieve the password:

	a. From the seed cloud host log in to the undercloud as super user:

		ssh heat-admin@<undercloud IP> 
		sudo su - 

	b. Enter the following command to display the password:

		cat  /root/work/tripleo/tripleo-undercloud-passwords

	Make note of the password.
