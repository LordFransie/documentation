<!--1 - **Install CMC**
     
   [Install CMC](#install-hp-storevirtual-cmc) on the seed node where the seed cloud is running. The CMC binary comes along with the HP Helion OpenStack installer and is present in the **Tripleo** directory. 

2 - **Add VSA Baremetal nodes to ironic database**
	
   * Identify the hardware for StoreVirtual deployment and enroll the Baremetal to the ironic database.

   * Log in to the undercloud and source the environment variables(source stackrc).

   * Execute ironic CLI commands from the undercloud to enroll the Baremetal into ironic database.
   
   * [Deploy StoreVirtual storage systems](#deployment-vsa).

3a - **Run update cloud script to provision VSA node**

   * After the [enrollment of the new Baremetal server](#deployment-vsa) in the undercloud, log in to the seed cloud.

   * Update the *overcloud.json* file for StoreVirtual deployment and apply the configuration.
	
   * Execute the update cloud script.

3b - **Discover StoreVirtual in CMC**

   * After updating the cloud, StoreVirtual system is deployed in the new Baremetal server that is enrolled.

   * Create StoreVirtual cluster.

   * The IP address of the StoreVirtual storage system can be retrieved from `/etc/vsa/vsa_network_config.json` file in StoreVirtual node.

   * Launch the CMC and discover the StoreVirtual systems that have been deployed.

3c - **Create VSA cluster**

   * After discovering the StoreVirtual storage systems in CMC, [create the StoreVirtual cluster and management group](#create-cluster) from CMC.

4c - **Create VSA backend**

4d- **Get Cinder configuration for VSA backend**

   * Launch the Horizon Dashboard to [register and create backend for StoreVirtual](/helion/openstack/1.1/undercloud/oc/config/storevirtual/) system.
	
   * After creating the backend, generate the Cinder backend advisory for StoreVirtual.

5a - **Update `overcloud-config.json` file with cinder configuration**

   With the advise generated from the above steps, update the overcloud-config.json file in the seed cloud.

5b - **Run update cloud script to update cinder.conf**

   * The cinder.conf in the overcloud should be updated after updating the overcloud-config.json file in the seed cloud.

   * Execute [update cloud script](/helion/openstack/1.1/undercloud/oc/config/storevirtual/) from seed cloud. -->


##Installing HP StoreVirtual VSA Centralized Management Console (CMC) on Linux {#install-hp-storevirtual-cmc}

In order to configure the HP StoreVirtual VSA nodes, you must first install the CMC. You can manage all connected StoreVirtual VSA instances from single CMC connected to HP Helion OpenStack management network.


### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

* You must be running the X Windows System to install the CMC.

* We recommend that you install CMC on the same KVM host that is used to run the seed VM. This host has direct network connectivity to servers running HP StoreVirtual VSA. However, you may select an alternate host as long as it is accessible from the HP Helion OpenStack management network.


**Note**: These changes are required for 64-bit operating system only.

* Execute the following commands:

		# apt-get update
		# dpkg --add-architecture i386
		# apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk:i386

### Installation {#installation}

1. Verify if the CMC installer file inside `tripleo` directory (packaged along with the HP Helion OpenStack&#174; installer) has the executable permission otherwise execute the following command:

		# chmod +x CMC_11.5.01.0079.0_Installer_Linux.bin

2. Launch the installer

		# ./CMC_11.5.01.0079.0_Installer_Linux.bin

3. Follow the steps in the console based installation wizard to complete the installation.

4. To start the CMC if you have direct GUI access:<br />
 From the directory in which the files are installed, click the **HP Store Virtual Centralized Management Console** to launch CMC.  

	**Note**: To launch the CMC from command line (CLI), navigate to the location where it is installed and enter 
			
     	# ./"HP Store Virtual Centralized Management Console".

	Alternatively, if you use a remote server, you can connect to the head node using XRDP and configure the storage using CMC through an RDP session.:

		To do this, on the head node:
		
		apt-get install xrdp
		
		service xrdp start
		
		From a Windows laptop (for example) use rdp (mstsc.exe), enter the IP address of the head node and Click Connect
		
		At the login prompt enter you credentials and click OK
		
		When the remote desktop connection screen open, click on the RDP terminal session and type
		
		cd /opt/hp/storevirtual/ui
		
		java -jar UI.jar
		
	to start the CMC GUI.

	**Note:** In the event that you cannot see what you are typing in the RDP terminal session,

	xterm -fg black -bg white &

	A second RDP terminal session will open in the RDP session and you can then proceed as above - that is:

		cd /opt/hp/storevirtual/ui
		
		java -jar UI.jar

	to start the CMC GUI.

##Deploying HP StoreVirtual VSA {#deploy-vsa}


###Prerequisites {#prerequisites-vsa}

Ensure the following prerequisites are fulfilled before HP StoreVirtual Storage systems are deployed:

* Before enrolling the new Baremetal server for StoreVirtual deployment, ensure that `#ironic node-list` in the undercloud server does not have any free nodes.This is required to register a new node which matches the disk requirements for StoreVirtual and is picked by the installer for StoreVirtual deployment.

 
* Ensure that you have created a minimum of two(2) RAID groups. You can create a maximum of eight(8) groups. The first RAID group where the OS image is deployed is not considered for StoreVirtual storage.

* Each physical disk should be RAID protected and should not be RAID 0. You can use RAID 5 and above. <!---For more details, refer - [**Storevirtual documentation LINK**]-->

* For deploying StoreVirtual systems without Adaptive Optimization (AO) the setup must have a minimum two(2) disks(/dev/sda, /dev/sdb).

* For deploying StoreVirtual systems with Adaptive Optimization (AO) the setup must have at least three(3) disks(/dev/sda, /dev/sdb,/dev/sdc). The disk /dev/sdb should be a Solid State Drive(SSD).


* Ensure that you create the RAID group for SSD drives immediately after creating the RAID group for boot volume. For example: If three RAID groups are to be created. The following is recommended :

      **Step 1**: Create the first RAID group for HDD drives and mark this as boot volume(/dev/sda)
        
	   **Step 2**: Create the second RAID group for SSD drives which should be used as Tier 0 for AO (/dev/sdb)
         
	   **Step 3**: Create the third RAID group for HDD drives which will be used as Tier 1(/dev/sdc)

* Seed Cloud is installed and is running.
 
* The bundled license for the StoreVirtual VSA has a maximum limit of 50TB per node, and hence the total amount of the configured storage on the StoreVirtual system should not exceed 50 TB.

#### Enrolling the New Baremetal Server {#enroll-new-baremetal-server}

The following steps to deploy HP StoreVirtual VSA are optional if you have not already added VSA in your initial installation:


**Note:** Before enrolling the new Baremetal server for StoreVirtual deployment, ensure that `ironic node-list` in the undercloud server does not have any free nodes suitable for StoreVirtual installation. If a suitable node is available, skip the Baremetal registration steps and go to **step 5** below.


You must add a server to the cloud inventory to handle the increased number of nodes. 

Perform the following steps to add a physical server:

1. Log in to the seed VM:

		ssh root@<Seed IP Address>

2. Make the respective Baremetal entry in `/root/baremetal.csv`.   
	
3. Add the node to `baremetal.csv` at the end.

		<mac_address>,<user>,<password>,<ip_address>,<no_of_cpus>,<memory_MB>,<diskspace_GiB>,<role>,<power_managemenment>

	The following sample displays the output of the above command:

		E8:39:35:2B:FA:30,administrator,password,10.1.192.46,12,73728,70,OvercloudVSAAOStorage,IPMI
		9C:B6:54:AD:55:A8,administrator,gone2far,10.1.192.50,12,73728,70,OvercloudVSAStorage,IPMI



  	Ensure that a new node is added at the end of the file. 

3. Edit the scale counts in JSON environment variables file ( for example: `kvm-custom-ips.json`) that was used during the initial installation to define the appropriate scale number:

		"vsa_scale": "<no of StoreVirtual systems>"
		"vsa_ao_scale": "<no of StoreVirtual systems with AO enabled>"



4. Source the environment variables file created during initial installation.

		# source tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_load_config.sh tripleo/configs/<environment variables file name>

	For example:

		# source tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_load_config.sh tripleo/configs/kvm-custom-ips.json


5. Run the installer script:

		bash -x tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh --update-overcloud 2>&1 | tee update.log


   This will register a new ironic node and create a new nova instance and a new heat stack.

<!--**Caution**: Do not provision proxy and scale-out object nodes together. The requirements are different for proxy nodes and scale-out object nodes. It is recommended that you use HP DL380 or HP SL230 servers for Proxy nodes and SL4540 servers for scale-out Object storage nodes.-->
 <!--	**Note**: While deploying a scale-out **proxy** node ensure that the value of `vsa_scale` is unchanged. While deploying a scale-out **object** node ensure that the value of `vsa_ao_scale` is unchanged.-->
**NOTE**: For HP StoreVirtual VSA, a management group with two storage systems and a Failover Manager is the minimum configuration for automated fault tolerant operations. Configurations greater than two systems can be redundant and do not require a Failover Manager. The Failover Manager is a specialized version of the LeftHand OS software designed to operate as a manager and provide automated failover capability. It runs as a virtual appliance and must be installed on a separate system/VM  other than the storage systems in the SAN.

##Verifying StoreVirtual installation status {#verify-install}

To verify that the StoreVirtual storage system is deployed successfully, perform the following checks:

1. Log in to the undercloud from seed.


		# ssh heat-admin@<undercloud IP address>

 		 
2. Source stackrc file and list the deployed StoreVirtual nodes.

		# source stackrc 
		# heat stack-list
		# nova list|grep vsa

3. Log in to the StoreVirtual system from the seed using the IP address retrieved 
from the above steps.

		# ssh heat-admin@<StoreVirtual system IP Address>

4. Check the log files.

		# tail-f /installer.log

	The message "*Started VM vsa-hostname*" indicates the successful installation of StoreVirtual on the machine.The IP Address of the StoreVirtual storage system can be retrieved from this log file.

5. To display the status of all the StoreVirtual VMs.

		# virsh list --all 

	To get more details on the installer logs, check the `/var/log/storevirtual-installer.log` file.

6. On successful installation of StoreVirtual VM on Baremetal, go to the Centralized Management Console(CMC) and discover the storage systems.
