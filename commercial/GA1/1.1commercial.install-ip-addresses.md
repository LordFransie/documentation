# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Locating IP Address

If you need to locate IP addresses of the seed VM, the undercloud node or the overcloud controller, see the following sections.

* [Locate the Seed VM IP Address](#seed)
* [Locate the Undercloud IP Address](#under)
* [Locate the Overcloud IP Address](#over)

## Locate the Seed VM IP Address ## {#seed}

To locate the seed VM IP address, from the seed cloud host, execute the following commands:

1. Use virsh to display information on the seed VM.

		sudo virsh dumpxml seed|grep mac

	The output appears similar to the following:

		<partition>/machine</partition>
		<type arch='x86_64' machine='pc-i440fx-trusty'>hvm</type>
		<mac address='52:54:00:5b'/>
		<mac address='00:55:5c:17'/>
 
2. Use the arp command to locate the IP address using the MAC address.

		arp -n | grep 00:55:5c:17

	The output appears similar to the following:

		10.23.70.10	ether	00:55:5c:17:e8:17	C	brbm

The seed VM IP address for this cloud is `10.23.70.10`.

## Locate the Undercloud IP Address ## {#under}

To locate the IP address needed to log into the undercloud node:

1. Log into the seed VM.


		ssh root@&#60;seed_VM_IP_address> 

	**Example:**

		ssh root@10.23.70.10

2. Execute the following commands:

		. /root/stackrc
		UNDERCLOUD_IP=$(nova list | cut -d '|' -f 7 | grep ctlplane | awk -F  = '{print $2}')
		echo $UNDERCLOUD_IP

The undercloud IP address appears. 


## Locate the Overcloud IP Address ## {#over}

To locate the IP address to log into the overcloud controller: 

1. Log into the seed VM.

		ssh root@&#60;seed_VM_IP_address> 

	**Example:**

		ssh root@10.23.70.10

2. Execute the following commands:

		. /root/tripleo/tripleo-undercloud-passwords
		TE_DATAFILE=/root/tripleo/ce_env.json
		. /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/undercloudrc
		OVERCLOUD_IP=$(heat output-show overcloud-ce-controller KeystoneURL | cut -d: -f2 | sed s,/,,g )
		echo $OVERCLOUD_IP

The overercloud IP address appears.
