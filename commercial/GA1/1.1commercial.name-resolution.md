# HP Helion OpenStack&reg; 1.1: Enable Name Resolution from Tenant VMs in the Overcloud
[See version 1.0 of this page](/helion/openstack/name-resolution/)

This page provides instructions for setting a default DNS name server for your HP Helion OpenStack cloud. These steps need to be performed prior to installation.

**Note:** After the installation, you can specify DNS servers on a per-subnet basis using the `neutron subnet-create --dns-nameserver` command. Refer to the OpenStack documentation, such as [Advanced Networking operations](http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/advanced_networking.html).

## Enabling name resolution

To enable name resolution from tenant VMs in the overcloud, it is necessary to configure the DNS servers that will be used by `dnsmasq` as forwarders.

1. Log in to your install system as root:

	`sudo su -`

2. Locate the `overcloud_neutron_dhcp_agent.json file` at `ce-installer/tripleo/hp_passthrough/overcloud_neutron_dhcp_agent.json`

3. Add the desired `dnsmasq_dns_servers` items by modifying the `value` field with the IP address of your DNS server.  Multiple DNS servers can be specified as a comma separated list.

	Your JSON should appear similar to the following:

		{"dhcp_agent":
			{"config":
				[
					{"section":"DEFAULT",
						"values":
							[
								{"option":"dhcp_delete_namespaces","value":"True"},
								{"option":"dnsmasq_dns_servers", "value":"0.0.0.0"}
							]
						}
					]
				}
			}


4. Copy the `overcloud_neutron_dhcp_agent.json` file to a new file named `undercloud_neutron_dhcp_agent.json` to configure the same forwarders for the undercloud.

## Next Step

* [Return to the baremetal install](/helion/community/install/)

* [Return to the virtual install](/helion/community/install-virtual/)
