**HP Helion OpenStack Metering services** The [HP Helion OpenStack Telemetry and Reporting service](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/reporting/overview/) leverages the OpenStack Ceilometer metering service. The Metering Operations service takes specified measurements of both physical and virtual resources, including physical servers and network devices such as switches and firewalls.

**Additional Components in Centralized Logging** [Centralized logging support](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/logging/overview/) has now been added for the following additional components: <!--HPM-28-->

- HAProxy
- Syslog
- Keepalived 

**AppArmor profiles enabled for Compute nodes** AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and applications from external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior and preventing even unknown application flaws from being exploited. <!--HPM27-->

**Windows Server validation as a guest O/S on KVM** - HP Helion OpenStack 1.1 has achieved [Microsoft Server Virtualization Validation Program](http://www.windowsservercatalog.com/svvp/) (SVVP) approval.  As such, HP Helion OpenStack is a validated and supported virtual environment for Windows Server 2012 R2, 2012, 2008 R2, and 2008.  <!--HPM-29--> 

For information on creating and deploying a Microsoft Windows Server that is Microsoft SVVP compliant on HP Helion OpenStack as a Nova compute VM, see [How to build a Microsoft Windows Server guest image for HP Helion OpenStack](/helion/openstack/1.1/create-deploy/certified-microsoft-windows/guest-image/).  <!--DOCS-917-->

Microsoft can provide technical support to customers with licensed Windows Server Operating Systems that are deployed as Nova compute VMs.

**Swift diagnostic checks** - New diagnostics checks have been implemented for [Swift cluster](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/object/overview/). Diagnostic messages are sent to the [Icinga service](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/object/swift/replica-status/). <!--HPM15-->

**Improved recovery time** - When a virtual IP is moved to another overcloud controller on the system, the controller will become available in approximately one minute. <!--HPM121-->

**New Horizon Dashboard functionality** - The [HP Helion OpenStack DNSaaS service](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/dnsaas/) functionality is now accessible through the [Horizon dashboard](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/horizon/).

**Multipath suppport for 3PAR** -  HP Helion OpenStack now supports multipath for multiple I/O paths . Multipath helps maintain a constant connection between KVM host and its storage. See [Configuring Multipath for 3PAR](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/3par/).<!--HPM121-->

**Transport Layer Security (TLS) support** - HP Helion OpenStack now supports TLS protocols to protect internal traffic for Overcloud OpenStack API and endpoints. <!--HPM16-->

**HP Helion OpenStack Identity service** - The Identity service, based on OpenStack Keystone V2 or V3 provides one-stop authentication, including Identity, Token, Catalog and Policy services. See [Identity Service Overview](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/identity/overview/).

**Fibre Channel Zone Manager support** - The OpenStack Fibre Channel Zone Manager creates the necessary Fibre Channel zones during an attach of a Block Storage (Cinder) volume. Brocade Fibre Channel Zone Driver performs zoning operations via SSH. See [Configuring Fibre Channel Zone Manager](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/volume/Fibre/).<!--HMP32-->

**Enable Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) support for Gen8 and Gen9 HP Servers** - UEFI is industry standard set of interfaces between the system firmware, the operating system, and between various components of the system firmware delivers enhanced security benefits for the HP ProLiant Gen8 and Gen9 Server family. UEFI is meant to replace the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface. For more information, see [HP Unified Extensible Firmware Interface](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/server-software/product-detail.html?oid=6935826).<!--HPM12-->

**Compute Service Configuration Drive** - The HP Helion OpenStack compute service can be configured to [write metadata to a special configuration drive](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/compute/overview/configdrive) that contains information normally available through the metadata service. 

**Ruby CLI No Longer Supported** - The Ruby CLI (unix_cli) is no longer supported. Users are advised to consider the Python CLIs as an alternative.

### Features in HP Helion OpenStack 1.01 ### {#101}

The following features have been added to HP Helion OpenStack 1.01:

**Defect fixes** - A number of defects were addressed and fixed in this release.

**Security documentation** - A new document is included in this release that contains recommendations for securing your HP Helion OpenStack network. [Configuring your network securely](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/security/) details the firewall rules you can apply at the edge of the HP Helion OpenStack deployment to protect against external abuse and defines router rules within the HP Helion OpenStack deployment to protect against insider abuse or administrative errors.

**HP Helion OpenStack Flexible Control Plane** - The [HP Helion OpenStack Flexible Control Plane](/helion/openstack/1.1/flexiblecontrol/overview) introduces the capacity to deploy the control plane in a virtual environment in addition to the current baremetal physical deployment. This new configuration reduces the control plane footprint to just three servers from the current seven to ten servers.


### Features in HP Helion OpenStack 1.0 ### {#10}

The following features have been added to HP Helion OpenStack 1.0:

**OpenStack Services** - The full set of standard [OpenStack services](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/overview/#OpenStack) is in HP Helion OpenStack: Nova (Compute), Swift (Object Operations), Cinder (Volume Operations), Neutron (Networking Operations), Glance (Image OPerations), Keystone (Identity Management), Horizon (Helion dashboard), Heat (Orchestration), TripleO, and Ironic.

**Other Services** - [Other services](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/overview/#OpenStack/#Other) included in the release include: Sherpa, Sirius, EON, DNSaaS, and DVR.

**HP StoreVirtual VSA** -  [HP StoreVirtual VSA](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/storage-software/product-detail.html?oid=5306917) is storage virtualization software used as the default fault-tolerant, software-defined storage backend for the Volume Operations service, and provides easy deployment on KVM nodes meeting on-demand scale-out requirements of cloud storage without sacrificing performance.

**Support for VMWare ESX** - VMWare ESX is a baremetal hypervisor. HP Helion OpenStack makes ESX host onboarding and management easier and lets you setup the ESX proxy node during installation of the overcloud. 

**HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) Application** - Enables you to create networks, subnets and ports, as well as security groups and security group rules for your ESX clusters using OVSvApp.

## Known Issues in this Release ## {#known-issues}

The following are the known issues for HP Helion OpenStack:

**Operational Issues**

When using HP Helion OpenStack you might experience the following issues:

* When a significant update operation is performed, such as adding or removing nodes, connectivity to the VM will drop until the operation is completed. This may last for up to 15 minutes.

* A snapshot of an instance that was launched from a bootable volume might not boot. In addition, the Glance CLI and Horizon Dashboard might not report the snapshot properly. The snapshot will be listed as an image (not a snapshot) with a size of 0 and a blank disk format.

	Even though with Horizon and CLI report the snapshot incorrectly,  the snapshot launches properly. <!-- (GLAN-1706) -->

* If you use the Updates and Extensions tab of the Helion Dashboard for the overcloud (known as the *Sherpa UI*) to download two images that use the same name in two different projects, the second image will fail to upload to the Image Operations service (Glance). Avoid using images that use the same name. <!-- (CODN-24) -->

* If, for some reason, the overcloud compute service is rebooted, the VMs might be in an ERROR state. Execute the following commands to restart the services and remove the error(s):
  
		sudo service nova-compute restart
		sudo service nova-scheduler restart
		sudo service nova-conductor restart
		sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart

* In some instances, the centralized logging feature does not function after the  product installation. If this occurs, perform the following steps on the overcloud controller and all compute nodes:

        service rsyslog restart
        

**Networking Issues**

* Under heavy load, the neutron-openvswitch-agent can fail to properly clean-up old virtual network interfaces resulting in degraded performance.  Restarting the neutron-openvswitch-agent can correct this problem. <!-- VNETCORE-490 DOCS-1062 -->

<!-- Removed per Jack McCann
* When Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) is enabled, private IP address communication between instances on the same Neutron network is slower than public IP address communication. DVR speeds-up public IP address communication between instances on the same Neutron network, making private IP address communucation appear slower than public IP address communication. VNETCORE-441 DOCS-1063 
 -->

* With Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) enabled, the performance of the `neutron router-interface-delete` command is known to degrade significantly as the number of routers or compute nodes increases. <!-- VNETCORE-448 DOCS-1061 -->

* When creating very large numbers of instances in a synchronous manner, sporadic instance creation failure may be experienced. To work around this behavior, lower the instance creation rate until consistent success is achieved. <!-- VNETEE-53 DOCS-1050 -->


**Helion Dashboard Issues**

When using HP Helion OpenStack you might experience the following issues:

* On the **Floating IPs** tab in the Helion Dashboard (**Project > Access & Security > Floating IPs**) all of the buttons (Associate, Disassociate, Release Floating IP) might not appear under certain circumstances. To make the buttons appear, first attempt to allocate a new floating IP. If the buttons are still not present, log out and log in as the same user. 

	To potentially avoid this issue, when creating users and projects, first create the project, then create user(s), and add those users to the project (rather than creating the user first, then creating a project).<!--(HORI-3110) -->

* Volume backups that are created in one project are accessible to all projects. In other projects, the information displayed might not be correct. Volume backups should not appear in other projects. There is no workaround. <!-- (HORI-3009) -->

* Changing the user settings in a non-admin role affects all users across all projects. Changes to a user role should not affect other roles. There is no workaround. <!-- (HORI-2934) -->

* An admin is unable to retrieve object details in an Object Store. The admin might see a blank dialog box or receive the *Error: Unable to retrieve details.* error. Access object details as a non-admin user. <!-- (HORI-2930) -->

* An admin user will receive an error message *Error: Unable to retrieve user list.* while trying to access **Users** from the **Identity Panel**.  To work with users, an admin should use the CLI tools rather than the Horizon console. <!-- DOCS-723 --> 

* An admin user in the default domain is not able to edit Projects. <!--DOCS-727, DOCS-731 --> 

**Update Issues**

You may experience the following issues when performing updates in this release:

- Depending on configuration, an overcloud update may take longer than was the case in earlier releases. 
<!--ANSUPDATE-276/DOCS-1070 -->

- After an update, the node removal procedure might not work.  This is a known issue.<!-- CORE-2940 / DOCS 1068  -->

- Overcloud updates may fail because you cannot stop VSA VMs. Overcloud updates require that all VMs be stopped before an update can proceed. During an overcloud update, you may find that you are not able to stop the VSA VM (by issuing a `virsh stop` command). This causes the update to stop.   


	To fix this problem you can use the VSA command-line interface (CLIQ) to shut down VSA on the VM that cannot be shut down. You can access CLIQ by running ssh to port 16022 on the Virtual IP for the VSA server. If you do not know the IP address/username/password of the VSA system, you can find it in **/etc/cinder/cinder.conf** on controller0 on the overcloud.
    
	    ssh -l <username> <IP> -p 16022
	    ClIQ> shutdownNsm action=Shutdown
        
	Proceed with the update.
<!--CORE 2981 / DOCS 1067-->


<!-- Cinder cannot create volumes after a system update.   A resolution is under development. per DOCS 1182  -->

<!-- Cinder fails to create Bootable Volumes after a system update. It appears that ISCSI authentication is failing on controller0. The workaround is to migrate the `cinder-volume` service to another node, for example, controller1, and to stop the `cinder-backup` service on controller0.
Performing backups and creating bootable volumes will then work.-->   <!--CORE-2987 / DOCS 1064--> 
 
- Cinder might fail after an update. To fix Cinder,  restart the `cinder-volume` service on controller0 by entering: <!-- DOCS-1047 -->

    	$ sudo service cinder-volume restart

	Then restart the `cinder-backup` service on all three overcloud controller nodes by entering:

    	$ sudo service cinder-backup restart

	For more information on how to restart the singleton Cinder volume  service, see [HP Helion OpenStack 1.1: High Availability](/helion/openstack/high-availability/#cinder-volume).

-  <!--DOCS-1032--> Cinder backup and create bootable volume functions fail after an update. A workaround exists if this is an ISCSI error.  To determine if this is an ISCSI error, grep for the following string in in `/var/log/cinder/cinder-volume.log` on controller0:

    	grep 'Failed to copy image <image-id> to volume: <volume-id>, error: iscsiadm: No session found.' /var/log/cinder/cinder-volume.log

	If this is an ISCSI error, you will see confirmation in the return, for example:


   		 2015-02-23 13:46:01.415 21650 ERROR cinder.volume.flows.manager.create_volume [req-918f993f-5456-4eba-a266-67a638e9aa99 9f5ec59efa57483aad14b20378091195 c4b1111b613c4454a4cb3101ac420f54 - - -] Failed to copy image eeecc4aa-8a99-447d-848f-c40f4af0d606 to volume: 0260a9e1-2e4a-444f-81d7-867f63f23fe9, error: iscsiadm: No session found.

	If you confirm that the error is present on Controller0, then the workaround is to:
	- migrate the cinder-volume service to another node, for example, controller1 (refer to [HP Helion OpenStack 1.1: High Availability](/helion/openstack/high-availability/#cinder-volume))
	 
	- stop the cinder-backup service on controller0 using
			
			sudo service cinder-backup stop

    Performing backups and creating bootable volumes will then work. 

**Other Issues**

Other issues you might experience when using HP Helion OpenStack:

 <!-- (DOCS-839) -->

* If a project and user has been deleted, a user cannot log in to the project in the Helion Dashboard and delete networks associated with the project and user. To clean up artifacts created by a user account that has been deleted, use the CLI tools rather than the Horizon console. <!--(DOCS-733) -->

	 <!--(NOV-6664) -->

* A Kernel Panic error occurs on DL 360 G7 systems when a user employs SSH to log in to a virtual machine and attempts to connect to an IP address external to HP Helion OpenStack. If this occurs, update the kernel to the latest version. <!-- (EE-21) -->

* When a controller node crashes, it must be rebooted to return to its operational state. <!-- (CORE-1387) -->

* The installation process leaves behind it a running VM, and a shared internal network `default-net`.

	This shared internal network can cause problems when running Tempest tests. If this is an issue, you can remove the `demo` VM and the `default-net` network. <!-- (CORE-586) -->

* The Compute service does not handle or recover from RabbitMQ Server process failure. <!-- (CORE-1559) -->

* The Keepalived processes do not restart automatically when they are killed. Use the service `keepalived start` to restart Keepalived. <!-- (CORE-972) -->

* The HAProxy does not automatically restart when it is killed. Restart haproxy manually using `service haproxy restart`. <!-- (CORE-943) -->

* A user can register but cannot update a vCenter through the UI. 
<!--
- Heat templates and updating Helion: If you  are using a modified heat template, you should update the new templates that are provided with the installer to reflect what you had modified in your previous deployment. If you have not made any changes to the original template, then you can execute
 `./tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh -??-update-undercloud` 
and
 `./tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh -??-update-overcloud` 
to update the HEAT templates.
-->
<!-- above is for patch or update -->
- Icinga monitoring reports Cinder false alarms. <!--core2977/2985-->The Icinga monitor for the Cinder volume service runs on all three Helion controller nodes (Controller0, 1 and 2), but the Cinder volume service only runs on Controller0. Icinga may send a "Critical Alert" that the Cinder volume service is not running on Controller1 and Controller2. This is a false alarm, since the service does not run on those controllers, and can be ignored; there is no actual impact to any service. 

- Live migration of an instance in stopped, suspended, or rescued state may fail. Make sure instances are not in the stopped, suspended, or rescued state before attempting to migrate them to a new host. A 400 error may appear; a message "Failed to migrate instance..." may be received; or the client may quietly time out, leaving the instance stuck in the migrating state and thus unmanageable. <!-- DOCS-823 -->
