# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1  Troubleshooting DNS issues with Neutron

HP Helion OpenStack&#174; is an OpenStack technology coupled with a version of Linux&#174; provided by HP. This topic describes all the known issues that you might encounter. To help you resolve these issues, we have provided possible solutions.

### Configuring the `dnsmasq_dns_servers` list for the undercloud and overcloud {#config_dnas}

To enable name resolution from tenant VMs in the overcloud, it is necessary to configure the DNS servers which will be used by `dnsmasq` as forwarders.  To perform this:

1. Edit the `overcloud_neutron_dhcp_agent.json` file in the
`ce-installer/tripleo/hp_passthrough` directory to add the desired `dnsmasq_dns_servers`
items. 
2. Copy the `overcloud_neutron_dhcp_agent.json` file to a
new file named `undercloud_neutron_dhcp_agent.json` and configure the same
forwarders for the undercloud.
