##Fatal PCI Express Device Error {#fatal-pci}

**System Behavior/Message**

When installing on HP ProLiant SL390s and HP ProLiant BL490d systems, the following error has occasionally occurred:

    `Fatal PCI Express Device Error PCI Slot ? B00/D00/F00`


**Resolution**

If you get this error, reset the system that experienced the error:

   1. Connect to the iLO using Internet Explorer:
        `https://<iLO IP address>`
   2. Navigate to Information / Diagnostics.
   3. Reset iLO.
   4. Log back into the iLO after 30 seconds.
   5. Navigate to Remote Console / Remote Console.
   6. Open the integrated remote console (.NET).
   7. Click Power switch / Press and Hold.
   8. Click Power switch / Momentary Press, and wait for the system to restart.

   The system should now boot normally.

##IPMI fails with an error- unable to establish IPMI v2 / RMCP+ session {#IPMI-fails}

**System Behavior/Message**

When installing on HP ProLiant BL490c systems, the following error has occasionally occurred:


    unable to establish IPMI v2 / RMCP+ session

**Resolution**

If you get this error, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that the iLO user has administrator privileges, which is required by the IPMITOOL.
2. To check from the iLO remote console, reboot the server and press **F8** to get to iLO Management screen.
3. Click **User** in the menu-bar and select **Edit**. Edit User pop-up box displays .
4. If you are using a BL server in the QA C7000 enclosure, select the **cdl** user to edit.
5. Use &darr;(down arrow key) to select **Administer User Accounts**. 
6. Use the space bar to set the value to **YES**.
7. Select **F10** to save.
8. Click **File** and select **Exit** to close.
<br /><br />
<hr />


## Failure of Update on the Overcloud {#failure-update-overcloud}

**System Behavior/Message**

Update overcloud fails with the following error:

<pre>Inconsistency between heat description ($OVERCLOUD_NODES) and overcloud configuration ($OVERCLOUD_INSTANCES)</pre>

**Resolution**

If you get this error, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to Seed.
 
		ssh root@<Seed IP address>

2. Edit the */root/tripleo/ce_env.json* file and update the variables **build&#95;number** and **installed&#95;build&#95;number** to the correct value. <!-- (CORE-1697) --> They may or may not match but the value cannot be NULL.

3. A sample section of the *ce&#95;env&#95;json* file showing that the **build&#95;number** is changed from NULL to a valid value.

		"host-ip": "192.168.122.1", 
		"hp": { 
		     "build_number": 11, 
		     "installed_build_number": 11 
		...
4. Run the installer script again to update the overcloud. During the installation, the build specified by build&#95;number is installed.
 
		bash -x tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh --update-overcloud |& tee update_cloud.log

<br />

## Installation failure as the flavor to be used for overcloud nodes does not match {#installation-failure}

**System Behavior/Message**

If you have a set of Baremetal servers which differ in specifications (e.g. memory and disk), the installation will fail as the flavor to be used for overcloud nodes does not match with the server that has the lowest specification for memory, disk, and CPU. 

**Probable Cause**

 The 2nd row in `baremetal.csv` which corresponds to the overcloud Controller node is used to create a flavor for the overcloud nodes.  

**Resolution**

Edit the *baremetal.csv* file to define the lowest specification server in the second row.
<br /><br />
<hr />

## PXE boot on target node keeps switching between interfaces {#PXE-boot-on-target}

**System Behavior/Message**

When node boots up on iLO console it shows node waiting for PXE boot on multiple NICs.


**Probable Cause**

 Multiple NICs are enabled for Network Boot.


**Resolution**

* Reboot the node, using **F9** to get to the BIOS configuration.
* Assuming NIC1(eth0/em1) for the node is connected to a private network shared across node enable it for Network Boot.
* Select System Options > Embedded NICs.
* Set NIC 1 Boot Options = Network Boot.
* Set NIC 2 Boot Options = Disabled.
<br /><br />
<hr />

## BIOS clocks are not set to correct date and time across all nodes {#bios-clocks-are-not-set-to-correct-date}


**System Behavior/Message**

Nodes PXE boot but ISCSI does not start.


**Probable Cause**

Time and date across nodes are incorrect.


**Resolution**

Reboot the node, using **F9** to get to the BIOS configuration. BIOS date and time are set correctly and the same on all the systems.

* Select Date and Time.
* Set the Date.
* Set the Time.
* Use the &lt;ENTER> key to accept the new date and time.
* Save the BIOS, which reboots the node again.
* Once the node has rebooted, you can confirm its data and time from the iLO Overview.
<br /><br />
<hr />

## iLO console shows hLinux daemon.err tgtd while PXE booting {#ilo-console}

**System Behavior/Message**

PXE boot gets stuck after `daemon.err tgtd`


**Probable Cause**

Node does not have enough disk space


**Resolution**

* Check if target node has disk space mentioned in `baremetal.csv` and is greater than Node_min_disk mentioned in `tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_functions.sh`.
* If disk space is less than Node&#95;min&#95;disk, change Node&#095;min&#095;disk along with DISK&#95;SIZE in `tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_list_nodes.sh` on Seed.
* Re-run the installation script.
<br />
<hr />

## iLO console shows null waiting for notice of completion while PXE booting {#ilo-show-null}

**System Behavior/Message**

Node is powered on and PXE booted but it is powered off after `daemon.err` and stack create fails.

**Probable Cause**

Node does not have enough disk space. SAN boot is enabled for node or local disk is not attached to `/sda`

**Resolution**

Installer expects that SAN boot option is disabled for nodes. Verify that SAN boot is disabled for BL 490c.

Also, you can boot the targeted BL490c with Ubuntu or any Linux ISO to see what device is shown as the local disk. For the installer it should be `/sda`.

<hr />

## Failure of hp_ced_installer.sh {#failure-installer}

**System Behavior/Message**

`hp_ced_installer.sh` fails because of bad characters in the `baremetal.csv`.


**Resolution**

Verify `baremetal.csv` does not contain any empty lines or special/corrupt characters.
<br /><br />
<hr />
## Failure of Seed Installation {#seed-install-failure}


**System Behavior/Message**

Seed installation fails with no space left on device.


**Resolution**

Verify the tripleo directory user owner and group. It must be **root:root**. 
In case it is not set as **root:root** then change it to root using: 

	chown root:root tripleo

<hr />
## Inconsistent Failures in RabbitMQ {#rabbit-failure}
**System Behavior/Message**

Inconsistent RabbitMQ failure seen on controller nodes while listing queues 

	rabbitmqctl list_queues

**Resolution**

Restart the RabbitMQ service.


<hr />
## Accidental Reboot of Overcloud Controller {#reboot-accident}

If the overcloud controller is rebooted (due to a power issue, hardware upgrade, or similar event), OpenStack compute tools such as `nova-list` might report that the VMs are in an ERROR state, rendering the overcloud unusable. 

To restore the overcloud to an operational state, follow the steps below:
 
  1. As user `root` on the overcloud controller you must:
  
     A. Run the `os-refresh-config` scripts:

        os-refresh-config

       B. Restart the `mysql` service:

        service mysql restart

       C. Re-run the `os-refresh-config` scripts:

        os-refresh-config

       D. Restart all Networking Operations (Neutron) services:

        service neutron-dhcp-agent restart
        service neutron-l3-agent restart
        service neutron-metadata-agent restart
        service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart
        service neutron-server restart

  2. On each overcloud node, restart the Neutron and Nova services:
  
        sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart
        sudo service nova-compute restart
        sudo service nova-scheduler restart
        sudo service nova-conductor restart


<hr />
## Server Power Stuck at Reset {#reset-stuck}
The installer uses IPMI commands to reset nodes and change their power status. Some systems change to a state in which the `Server Power` status as reported by the iLO is stuck in `RESET`. If this occurs, you must physically disconnect the power from the server for 10 seconds. If the problem persists after that, contact HP Support as there might be a defective component in the system.

<hr />
## Network Bridge Persists After Uninstall {#bridge-persists}
On the system on which the installer is run, the seed VM's networking is bridged onto the external LAN. If you remove HP Helion OpenStack, the network bridge persists.

To revert the network configuration to its pre-installation state, run the following commands as user `root`: 

	ip addr add 192.168.185.131/16 dev eth0 scope global
	ip addr del 192.168.185.131/16 dev brbm
	ovs-vsctl del-port NIC
where

* eth0 is the external interface     
* 192.168.185.131 is the IP address on the external interface - you should replace this with your own IP address.
* The baremetal bridge is always called 'brbm'

## Modify the Heat Configuration File Before HP Helion OpenStack Installation {#heat-config}

Before you install the HP Helion OpenStack DNSaaS or if you want to use Heat with HP Helion OpenStack, you **must** modify the /etc/heat/heat.conf file on the overcloud controller as follows.

<span style="color:red">**Important**:</span> The installation of the HP Helion OpenStack DNSaaS **fails** if you do not make these modifications.

**Note**: You must have admin ssh access to the overcloud controller.

1. Make sure the IP addresses in the following settings reflect the IP address of the overcloud controller, for example:
    
		heat_metadata_server_url = http://192.0.202.2:8000
		heat_waitcondition_server_url = http://192.0.202.2:8000/v1/waitcondition
		heat_watch_server_url = http://192.0.202.2:8003

2. Save the file.

3. Restart the Heat-related services &#8211; heat-api, heat-api-cfn, heat-api-cloudwatch, and heat-engine.

4. Ensure there are no Heat resources in an error state, and then delete any stale or corrupted Heat-related stacks.

## Seed Generates Restarting libvertd Script Error  {#seed-error}

**System Behavior/Message**

When starting your seed VM, if the script fails showing:

    + echo 'Restarting libvirtd...'
    Restarting libvirtd...
    + '[' -e /etc/debian_version ']'
    + service libvirt-bin restart
    stop: Unknown job: libvirt-bin
    start: Unknown job: libvirt-bin


**Resolution**

This problem can be caused by your use of `sudo –E` when executing the `hp_ced_host_manager`. Run  `hp_ced_host_manager ` without specifying `sudo –E`.

<hr />

<br />

## Node in Error Cannot be Controlled by Ironic or Nova {#ironic-error}

**System Behavior/Message**

Node goes into ERROR state and/or Ironic commands may result in a 400 or a 403 error code.
A a node being controlled by the seed or undercloud cannot be controlled either through Ironic or Nova.

**Resolution**

Run the following command:

	$mysql --defaults-file=/mnt/state/root/metadata.my.cnf   
	--socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock ironic -e 
	"select reservation from nodes;"


If the return form the command was not Null, repeat the command to see if Ironic is legitimately holding a lock.

If on the second attempt the lock was was still not NULL, run the following:

	$mysql --defaults-file=/mnt/state/root/metadata.my.cnf \
    --socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock ironic \
     -e 'update nodes set reservation=NULL where reservation is not null;'

Repeat the tests on the Ironic reservation:

	$mysql --defaults-file=/mnt/state/root/metadata.my.cnf   
	--socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock ironic -e "select reservation from nodes;"

You should now once again be able to use Ironic commands for the node.

If you were using Nova and the node when into ERROR, run 

	nova reset-state 

to clear the error and rerun the original Nova command.

## Debugging a Windows&#174; Server OS Using a Serial Connection {#windebug}
Debugging a Windows Server OS running as a Nova Compute VM on HP Helion OpenStack will require setting up a serial connection between the VM and a debug host. Once a serial connection has been established between the VM and debug host, which is usually over the COM2 port, the Windows Debug utility will function properly.

**Before you Begin**: 



- Deploy a [debug host on the same compute host](http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide-admin/content/specify-host-to-boot-instances-on.html) as the target Windows instance.
- The user will need to be able to log into the host with *superuser* privileges. To safely gain superuser privileges, add `sudo` as a prefix to each command executed.

**Set Up Serial Communication**

1. Log on to the Compute hosts where the Windows instances (target and debug hosts) are deployed.
2. Install the *socat* utility on the compute host. 
	
	The Debian package can be copied to the host and installed using:
	 
	 	sudo dpkg -i socat_1.7.2.4-1+b1_amd64.deb
	 
	or, if apt repositories are accessible from the host, use:
	 
		sudo apt-get install socat

3. Get the serial source path of the target and the debug host VMs.
	1. Get the libvirt xml of the target and the debug instance by running the command
	 
			sudo virsh dumpxml $vmname > $filename.xml

		Where *$vmname* is the name of the instance and	*$filename.xml* is the name of the output file to which the libvirt.xml will  be written.

	2. Look in the *filename.xml* file for the value of the **Source Path** for the target host. This value is found under the `Serial type='pty'` section. <br />Example:
	
			 ...
			<serial type='pty'>
				<source path='/dev/pts/4'/>
				<target port='1'/>
				<alias name='serial1'/>
			</serial>
			...

		In this example the value is  */dev/pts/4.*

	1. Repeat these steps to retrieve the serial source path value for the debug host. 
4.	Run the `socat` command to establish connection between the instances. In this example, the source path values were */dev/pts/4* and */dev/pts/5*. 
	
		sudo /usr/bin/socat /dev/pts/4 /dev/pts/5

## Using the sample DNS JSON file variable names for setup causes errors {#DNSvariables}
**System Behavior/Message**

DNS nameserver is not set up properly.


**Probable Cause**

Using the sample DNS JSON file variable names for setup causes errors.


**Resolution**

Configure your DNS servers using the following values:

`seed_server` - Use this variable to specify the DNS server for the seed node (do not use seed_nameserver).

`undercloud_server` - Use this variable to specify the DNS server for the undercloud node (do not use undercloud_nameserver).

`overcloud_server` - Use this variable to specify the DNS server for the overcloud nodes (do not use overcloud_nameserver).
		
	Do not copy these addresses they are only examples

	"dns": {
		"seed_server": "19.65.175.150:8080",
		"undercloud_server": "19.65.175.150:8080",
		"overcloud_server": "19.65.175.150:8080",
	}
