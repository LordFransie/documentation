### Contacting Customer Service {#sos} ###

If you need further assistance, contact [HP Customer Support](http://www.hpcloud.com/about/contact). 

#### Gathering information ####

Before contacting HP Customer Support, run the `run-sosreport` command on the affected system. You do not need to be root to run this command.

The command gathers specific information into a file that will help diagnose your issue. The file is located in the `/tmp` directory under a name in the format `sosreport-<system hostname>-<timestamp>.tar.xz`. For example: `/tmp/sosreport-hLinux-20150218083619.tar.xz`. 

Customer Support will help determine the best way to relay the information in the file to them.

<!-- not applicable until 1.1.1 per DOCS-1269
#### Determining the Helion OpenStack version ####

Run the following command on any Helion OpenStack node (seed, undercloud, overcloud control plane), to determine the installed version:

	# cat /etc/HP_Helion_version

A sample of output is:

	HP Helion OpenStack 1.1 Build 12
