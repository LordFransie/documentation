### Contacting Customer Service ### {#sos}

If you need further assistance, contact [HP Customer Support](http://www.hpcloud.com/about/contact). 

Before contacting HP Customer Support, run the `run-sosreport` command as `root` on the affected system. 

The command gathers specific information into a file that will help diagnose your issue. The file is located in the `/tmp` directory under a name in the format `sosreport-<system hostname>-<timestamp>.tar.xz`. For example: `/tmp/sosreport-hLinux-20150218083619.tar.xz`. 

Customer Support will help determine the best way to relay the information in the file to them.
