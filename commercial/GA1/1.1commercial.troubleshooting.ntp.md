# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Troubleshooting NTP


If your client (including your NTP server) has trouble syncing time, you can try the following.

1. Sync system time with system clock.

		hwclock [--utc | --localtime] -s --hctosys (update system time based on hardware clock)
		hwclock [--utc | --localtime] -w --systohc (update hardware clock based on system time)
		hwclock [--utc | --localtime] --systz (update system time based on timezone)

2. Verify hardware clock time.

		hwclock -r

3. Verify system time.

		date

4. If the times are still not synchronizing, check if the NTP ports are blocked.

		sudo apt-get install nmap

		sudo nmap -p123 -sU -P0 <localhost | known ntp host>
