[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/undercloud/resource/esx/compute/)

The HP Helion OpenStack Compute service provides a way to instantiate virtual machine instances on publicly accessible physical machines hosted in your cloud environment.

Compute allows you to work with **flavors**, which are unique combinations of disk space, memory capacity, and CPU; **images**, which are collections of files used as a base installation, typically operating systems such as Ubuntu 10.10; and **servers**, which are virtual instances created by combining a flavor and an image.

A variety of flavors and images are provided by the HP Helion Compute service to create a wide mix of servers.

Currently Compute Service has the following option:

* [Virtual Environments (ESX)](/helion/openstack/1.1/undercloud/resource/esx/)
