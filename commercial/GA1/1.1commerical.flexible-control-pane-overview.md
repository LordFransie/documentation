# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1 Flexible Control Plane Overview
The HP Helion OpenStack Flexible Control Plane architectural configuration enables you to deploy the control plane in a virtual environment. This new configuration reduces the control plane footprint to just three servers from the current seven servers.

This topic covers:

- [Deployment Architecture](#deploy)
- [Environment Details](#details)
- [Pre-requisites](#prereq)
	- [KVM Host Setup](#kvmsetup)
	- [Configurable Variables](#variables)
	- [Configuration Files](#configfiles)

Due to length, the [step-by-step installation instructions](/helion/openstack/1.1/flexiblecontrol/install/) are available separately.

##Overview
The Flexible Control Plane addresses the following concerns with the existing deployment model:

- Requires too many controller nodes
- Controllers must be physical servers
- Too large a footprint for smaller clouds

The Flexible Control Plane is supported for the following use cases:
 
- Evaluation
- Demonstration
- Proof of concept

Current Known Limitations:

- The Flexible Control Plane is not supported for production use.
- Backup and Restore of a FCP Cloud is not supported.
- Virtual Storage Appliance Adaptive Optimization (VSA-AO) is not supported.
- Upgrade of an FCP system is not tested for HP Helion OpenStack 1.1.
  

##Deployment Architecture {#deploy}
Currently, the Flexible Control Plane requires deployment on three KVM hosts.
Figure 1 illustrates the deployment of overcloud compute nodes and VSA nodes to physical servers. In the diagram, the seed VM, undercloud controller node, overcloud controller nodes, and Swift nodes are in the virtualized environment. The StoreVirtual node and overcloud compute nodes remain baremetal servers.

In the deployment scenario in Figure 2, the cloud control plane is distributed across three KVM hosts with the deployment of VSA storage nodes and overcloud Nova compute nodes on physical servers.

##Environment Details {#details}
The above environment contains the following networks:

- Management Network
- IPMI
- Service
- External

###Management Network
This network is used for most cloud traffic including: PXE boot nodes, tenant access to service APIs, internal API traffic between services (one service to another), HA heartbeats, tenant access to services, VxLAN traffic for between tenant VMs, VM access to block and object storage, object storage replication and synchronization between StoreVirtual VSAs, Object Operations service nodes, MySQL clusters, RabbitMQ clusters, keepalived, [HDN](https://helion.hpwsportal.com) access to the product catalog, logging traffic to centralized logging, monitoring checks to Icinga. 

In this example, the Management Network CIDR is 192.168.124.0/24.

###IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)
This is the network for server hardware management. 
In this example the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) address of the IPMI network is 192.168.1.0/24.

###Service
Connects trusted VMs in the overcloud to communicate with the cloud infrastructure component using this network. In this example, the Service Network CIDR is 192.168.125.0/24.

###External
This network is connected to the Internet or intranet and provides floating IPs. In this example the External Network CIDR is 172.32.100.0/24.            

##Hardware Details {#hardware}

###KVMHost
The following configuration is used for the KVM host:
 
- RAM: 256 GB
- CPU Cores: 20
- HDD: 2TB
- OS Installed: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

###VSA Nodes
Three (3) physical servers are used as VSA nodes.

- RAM: 12 GB
- CPU Cores: 8
- HDD: 8*1 TB

For more information, see [VSA overview](http://15.184.32.138/helion/openstack/1.1/install/vsa/overview/#StoreVirtual-overview-jumplink-span).

###Physical Compute
PC nodes have the same minimum requirements in Flexible Control Plane as in normal installations.
The following configuration is used for the overcloud compute node:

- RAM: 96GB
- CPU Core: 40
- HDD: 2TB

###Underseed (seed host) 
The following configuration is used for the underseed (seed host):

* RAM: 16GB
* CPU Core: 12
* HDD: 512GB

##Prerequisites {#prereq}
The Flexible Control Plane configuration has the same prerequisites as HP Helion OpenStack 1.01. Please be sure the environment satisfies the prerequisites before beginning installation.

- [Installation Prerequisites](http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/openstack/1.1/install/prereqs/)
- [Network Topology Requirements](http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/openstack/1.1/technical-overview/)
- [Hardware/Software Requirements](http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/openstack/1.1/support-matrix/)

###KVM Host Setup {#kvmsetup}
Set up KVM hosts and ensure all the hardware requirements are met and the required prerequisites are fulfilled before you begin your installation. Note that there are further prerequisites beyond those listed for HP Helion OpenStack 1.01 mentioned previously.

1.	The following packages must be installed on all the KVM hosts. 
	- xrdp
	- xfce4
	- qemu-kvm
	- openvswitch-switch
	- openvswitch-common
	- libssl-dev
	- libffi-dev
	- virt-manager
	- libvirt-bin
	- python-libvirt
	- chromium-browser
2.	Set up password-less SSH logins using the key generator in PuTTy or a similar application.
	- Set up the password-less logins between all the KVM hosts. This enables the root user of any KVM host to be able to log in via SSH to all other KVM hosts without a password.
	- Set up password-less login for the root user of the same KVM host. This enables the root user of the KVM host to be able to log in to the same KVM host without a password.

##Configurable Options for Flexible Control Plane {#options}
The following section describes the environment variables involved in configuring the Flexible Control Plane. These variables are new with Flexible Control Plane, so you won't have seen them before if you are familiar with the HP Helion OpenStack installation process.  You will set them during the installation process outlined in the [installation instructions](/helion/openstack/1.1/flexiblecontrol/install). Here, just take note of what is configurable in this release, and what the settings mean.

###Configurable Variables {#variables}

Below are descriptions of available configuration variables. Again, you will set these later, during the installation step-by-step process.

**HP\_VM\_MODE** Set this variable to specify the mode of deployment as single or hybrid. Currently, the options supported are: "y" and "hybrid".  To enable this feature, set the value to "hybrid".

	export HP_VM_MODE=HYBRID

###Configuration Files {#configfiles}
The Flexible Control Plane will also require the following configuration files in the root directory: **uc\_custom\_flavors.json** and **kvms.csv**. 

###Create a VM-plan file {#Create vm-plan file}
   
Create a VM-plan file (vm-plan) to represent the distribution of virtual machines over
   their hosts. This is an example vm-plan file and its format mirrors that of
   the baremetal.csv file:

	,user,,192.168.11.112,2,32768,,Undercloud,
	,user,,192.168.11.112,2,32768,,OvercloudControl,
	,user,,192.168.11.113,2,32768,,OvercloudControl,
 	,user,,192.168.11.114,2,32768,,OvercloudControl,
 	,user,,192.168.11.113,2,32768,,OvercloudSwift,
 	,user,,192.168.11.114,2,32768,,OvercloudSwift,

   Field 1 is ignored

   Field 2 is the kvm user under which the VM will run
        (This user does not have to be root)

   Field 3 is ignored

   Field 4 is the IP address of the remote kvm host
        (If empty, this will be the local host do not use 'localhost')

   Field 5 is the number of CPUs to give the virtual machine
        (You must specify this value; the minimum value is one CPU)

   Field 6 is the amount of memory in GiB the virtual machine will have
        (You must specify this value; the minimum value is 16GiB)

   Field 7 is ignored

   Field 8 is the role the virtual machine will have
        (You must specify this value see README-baremetal for valid roles)


   Note: physical baremetal nodes are added later, do NOT add them to this file


####kvms.csv
A kvms.csv file will also be created later via the [installation instructions](/helion/openstack/1.1/flexiblecontrol/install). It is required to define the KVM hosts being used for Flexible Control Plane deployment. This file contains the IP of the KVM host and an account with administrator or root privileges.
