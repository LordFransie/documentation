# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1 Flexible Control Plane Overview
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/flexiblecontrol/overview/)
The HP Helion OpenStack Flexible Control Plane (FCP) architectural configuration enables you to deploy the control plane in a virtual environment. This new configuration reduces the control plane footprint to just three servers from the current seven servers.

This topic covers:

- [Deployment Architecture](#deploy)
- [Environment Details](#details)
- [Pre-requisites](#prereq)
	- [KVM Host Setup](#kvmsetup)
	- [Configurable Variables](#variables)
	- [Configuration Files](#configfiles)

Due to length, the [step-by-step installation instructions](/helion/openstack/1.1/flexiblecontrol/install/) are available separately.

##Overview
The FCP addresses the issue of the relative size of the control plane being too large for smaller clouds. 
The FCP is supported for the following use cases: 

- Evaluation
- Demonstration
- Proof of concept

Current Known Limitations:

- The FCP is not supported for production use.
- Backup and Restore of a FCP Cloud is not supported.
- Virtual Storage Appliance Adaptive Optimization (VSA-AO) is not supported.
- Upgrade of an FCP system is not tested for HP Helion OpenStack 1.1.
  

##Deployment Architecture {#deploy}
Only one deployment architecture is possible, using three KVM hosts.
Figure 1 illustrates the deployment of overcloud compute nodes and VSA nodes to physical servers. In the diagram, the seed VM, undercloud controller node, overcloud controller nodes, and Swift nodes are in the virtualized environment. The StoreVirtual node and overcloud compute nodes remain baremetal servers.

In the deployment scenario in Figure 2, the cloud control plane is distributed across three KVM hosts with the deployment of VSA storage nodes and overcloud Nova compute nodes on physical servers.

##Environment Details {#details}
The above environment contains the following networks:

- Management Network
- IPMI
- Service
- External

###Management Network
This network is used for most cloud traffic including: PXE boot nodes, tenant access to service APIs, internal API traffic between services (one service to another), HA heartbeats, tenant access to services, VxLAN traffic for between tenant VMs, VM access to block and object storage, object storage replication and synchronization between StoreVirtual VSAs, Object Operations service nodes, MySQL clusters, RabbitMQ clusters, keepalived, [HDN](https://helion.hpwsportal.com) access to the product catalog, monitoring checks to Icinga. 

In this example, the Management Network CIDR is 192.168.124.0/24.

###IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)
This is the network for server hardware management. 
In this example the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) address of the IPMI network is 192.168.1.0/24.

###Service
Connects trusted VMs in the overcloud to communicate with the cloud infrastructure component using this network. In this example, the Service Network CIDR is 192.168.125.0/24.

###External
This network is connected to the Internet or intranet and provides floating IPs. In this example the External Network CIDR is 172.32.100.0/24.            

##Hardware Details {#hardware}

###KVMHost
The minimum recommended configurations are as follows: 
 
- RAM: 256 GB
- CPU Cores: 12
- HDD: 2TB

###VSA Nodes
Three (3) physical servers are used as VSA nodes.

- RAM: 12 GB
- CPU Cores: 8
- HDD: 8*1 TB

For more information, see [VSA overview](http://15.184.32.138/helion/openstack/1.1/install/vsa/overview/#StoreVirtual-overview-jumplink-span).

###Physical Compute
PC nodes have the same minimum requirements in Flexible Control Plane as in normal installations.
The following configuration is used for the overcloud compute node:

- RAM: 96GB
- CPU Core: 40
- HDD: 2TB

###Underseed (seed host) 
The following configuration is used for the underseed (seed host):

* RAM: 16GB
* CPU Core: 12
* HDD: 512GB

##Prerequisites {#prereq}
The FCP configuration has the same prerequisites as HP Helion OpenStack 1.1. Please be sure the environment satisfies the prerequisites before beginning installation.

- [Installation Prerequisites](http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/openstack/1.1/install/prereqs/)
- [Network Topology Requirements](http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/openstack/1.1/technical-overview/)
- [Hardware/Software Requirements](http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/openstack/1.1/support-matrix/)



##Configurable Options for Flexible Control Plane {#options}
The following section describes the environment variables involved in configuring the FCP, which you set during the installation process outlined in the [installation instructions](/helion/openstack/1.1/flexiblecontrol/install). 

###Configurable Variables {#variables}

Below are descriptions of configuration variables that are specifically applicable to configuring the FCP, which you will set during the installation step-by-step process.

- **HP\_VM\_MODE** 

	Set this variable to specify the mode of deployment as single or hybrid. Currently, the options supported are: "y" and "hybrid". To enable FCP, set the value to "hybrid".

	export HP_VM_MODE=hybrid

- **OVERCLOUD&#95;HYPERVISOR&#95;PUBLIC_INTERFACE** 
	
	Set this to the value of the name of the interface that carries the neutron external traffic on your overcloud compute nodes.
	The default value is eth2. If this is correct you do not need to set this variable.

		For example: $ export OVERCLOUD_HYPERVISOR_PUBLIC_INTERFACE=eth1

Refer to [Editing the Installation Configuration JSON File](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/envars/) for a full list of the environmental variables that control your installation. 

**Note:** For FCP, the following defaults apply to the variables below (tuned
to the FCP environment):

	undercloud.neutron_public_interface eth0
	overcloud.virtual_interface eth0
	overcloud.hypervisor_public_interface eth2
	overcloud.neutron_public_interface eth0
	overcloud.neutron_public_interface_raw_device ''
	<validate these names against the 'envars' section> 


###Create a VM-plan file {#Create vm-plan file}
   
Create a VM-plan file (vm-plan) to represent the distribution of virtual machines over
   their hosts. This is an example vm-plan file and its format mirrors that of
   the baremetal.csv file:

	,user,,192.168.11.112,2,32768,,Undercloud,
	,user,,192.168.11.112,2,32768,,OvercloudControl,
	,user,,192.168.11.113,2,32768,,OvercloudControl,
 	,user,,192.168.11.114,2,32768,,OvercloudControl,
 	,user,,192.168.11.113,2,32768,,OvercloudSwift,
 	,user,,192.168.11.114,2,32768,,OvercloudSwift,

   Field 1 is the BRIDGE_INTERFACE nic on the remote host.

(If empty, this will default to the same value of BRIDGE_INTERFACE as
         	used on the seed host)
        	For example: "eth7".


   Field 2 is the kvm user under which the VM will run
        (This user does not have to be root)

   Field 3 is ignored

   Field 4 is the IP address of the remote kvm host
        (If empty, this will be the local host do not use 'localhost')

   Field 5 is the number of CPUs to give the virtual machine
        (You must specify this value)

   Field 6 is the amount of memory in GiB the virtual machine will have
        (You must specify this value)

   Field 7 is ignored

   Field 8 is the role the virtual machine will have
        (You must specify this value. For more information, see the README-baremetal file for valid roles)


   Note: physical baremetal nodes are added later, do NOT add them to this file


####kvms.csv
A kvms.csv file will also be created later via the [installation instructions](/helion/openstack/1.1/flexiblecontrol/install). It is required to define the KVM hosts being used for Flexible Control Plane deployment. This file contains the IP of the KVM host and an account with administrator or root privileges.
