# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1 Horizon Service Overview#
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/services/horizon/overview/)

Horizon is the OpenStack service that serves as the basis for the HP Helion OpenStack web interface or **dashboards**.

The dashboards provide a web-based user interface to HP Helion OpenStack services including [Compute](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/compute/overview/), [Volume Operations](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/volume/overview/), [Networking](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/networking/overview), and [Identity](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/identity/overview). 

Horizon ships with several dashboards, including a **Project** dashboard, an **Admin** dashboard, and a **System** dashboard. These dashboards provide administrators and users with a graphical interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.

## For more information ##
