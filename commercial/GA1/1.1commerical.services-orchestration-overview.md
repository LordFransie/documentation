# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Orchestration Service (Heat) Overview#
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/services/orchestration/overview/)

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->

The HP Helion OpenStack Orchestration service leverages OpenStack Heat to provide template-based orchestration for describing a cloud application. It executes OpenStack API calls to generate running cloud applications.  

## Working with the Orchestration Service

To [perform tasks using the Orchestration service](#howto), you can use the dashboard, API or CLI.

### Using the dashboards<a name="UI"></a>

You can use the [HP Helion OpenStack Dashboard](/helion/openstack/1.1/dashboard/how-works/) to work with the Orchestration service.

###Using the API<a name="API"></a>
 
You can use a low-level, raw REST API access to the Orchestration service. See the [OpenStack Orchestration API v1 Reference](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-orchestration-v1.html).

###Using the CLI<a name="cli"></a>

You can use any of several command-line interface software to access the Orchestration service. See the [OpenStack Command Line Interface Reference](http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/heatclient_commands.html).

For more information on installing the CLI, see [Install the OpenStack command-line clients](http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/install_clients.html).

### Maintaining Heat templates ###
Because you can modify Heat templates, any updates to `openstack/tripleo-heat-templates` by design do not automatically overwrite existing templates. If you are using a modified heat template, then update the new templates provided with the installer to reflect your modifications in your previous deployment. 

If you have not made any changes to the original Heat template, then you can safely execute `./tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh --update-undercloud` and `./tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh --update-overcloud` to update the Heat templates.

## How To's with the HP Helion Orchestration Service ## {#howto}

Taken from http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/heatclient_commands.html 

The following lists of tasks can be performed by a user or administrator through the [HP Helion OpenStack Dashboard](/helion/openstack/1.1/dashboard/how-works/), the OpenStack [CLI](http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/heatclient_commands.html) or OpenStack [API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-orchestration-v1.html).

### Working with stacks ###

The Orchestration service allows users to work with stacks, which are a mechanism of using built-in stack definitions for specific resource types. This option allows you to perform the following functions:

- **Create and delete stacks** &#151; Create or delete stacks.
- **Resume a stack** &#151; Resume the operation of stacks.
- **Suspend A stack** &#151; Suspend the operation of stacks.
- **List a user's stacks** &#151; View a list of stacks for a specific user.
- **Describe a stack** &#151; View information on stacks.
- **List events for a stack** &#151; List system events for stacks.
- **Update a stack** &#151; Configure stacks.
- **Get the template for the specified stack** &#151; View the template used to create a stack.
- **Validate a template with parameters** &#151; Validate a stack template.
- **Show list of resources belonging to a stack** &#151; List infrastructure resources associated with a stack.
- **List resource metadata** &#151; Show a list of meta data associated with infrastructure resources.
- **Describe the resource** &#151; Show details of an infrastructure resource.

## For more information ##

For information on how to operate your cloud we suggest you read the [OpenStack Operations Guide](http://docs.openstack.org/ops/). The *Architecture* section contains useful information about how an OpenStack Cloud is put together. However, the HP Helion OpenStack takes care of these details for you. The *Operations* section contains information on how to manage the system.
