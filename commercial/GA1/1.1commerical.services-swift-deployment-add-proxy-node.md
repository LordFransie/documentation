# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Add New Scale-out Proxy Node
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/openstack/services/swift/deployment/add-proxy-node/)

This topic shows how to add a proxy node to the store account and container ring.

1. [Prerequisite](#prer)
2. [Deploying new node(s)](#deploying-new-node)


##Prerequisite {#prer}

* HP Helion OpenStack&#174; cloud is successfully deployed.<br /> *(Starter Object Sotrage (Swift) nodes are functional by default as they are part of cloud deployment)*
* Scale-out object-ring:1 is deployed.


##Deploying new node(s) {#deploying-new-node}

Perform the steps mentioned in  [Provision Node(s)](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/swift/provision-nodes/) to deploy a new node.


##Update load balancer with new Proxy nodes
 
1. Log in to the undercloud from seed.
 
		# ssh heat-admin@<undercloud IP address> 
		# sudo -i

2. Change the directory to ring builder.

		# cd /root/ring-building 

3. Copy account, container, object, and generated `object-1.ring.gz` files to proxy nodes and press **yes** when asked to authenticate the node. 

		# ringos copy-ring -s /root/ring-building/\*.ring.gz -n <proxy node IP address> 

4. Copy `object-1.builder` files to proxy nodes. 
 
		# ringos copy-ring -s /root/ring-building/\object-1.builder -n <proxy node IP address>

	**Note**: The `.buldier` and `.ring.gz` files **must** be present in the Swift nodes.

5. After creation of the Proxy node, list the Proxy IP addresses.

		# ringos list-swift-nodes -t proxy

6. List all the controller nodes

 		# nova list

7. Edit `swift-proxy.cfg` on each of the controller nodes. 

	 	/etc/haproxy/manual/swift-proxy.cfg

8. Add the following content in the `swift-proxy.cfg` file.

		  listen scale_swift_proxy
		  bind <Virtual IP (running on the controller nodes)>:8080
		  server <proxy node hostname> <proxy nodes IP address>:8080 check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5 

	**Note**:
			
	* The number of "server" lines equals the number of Swift Proxies you have set up.
	* For virtual IP: 

		* Login to the controller node
	
		  		# ssh heat-admin@<Controller Node IP address>
				# sudo -i

		*  Run the following command to view the virtual IP of the controller nodes

				vi /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf


9. Restart the HA Proxy service on all these nodes.

		# service haproxy restart

The Swift Proxies are now successfully enabled with HA Proxy. 

**Note**: You now must add account and container rings to the Swift Proxies. For these instructions, go to [Adding disk account containers](helion/openstack/1.1/services/swift/deployment/add-disk-account-container/).
