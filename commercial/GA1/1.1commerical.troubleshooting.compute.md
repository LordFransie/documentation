# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: Compute Service: Troubleshooting

## Storing Metadata on a Configuration Drive {#configdrive}
<!--DOCS-950-->
The HP Helion OpenStack compute service can be configured to [write metadata to a special configuration drive](/helion/openstack/1.1/services/compute/overview/configdrive/) that contains information normally available through the metadata service. 

##Compute Databases Become Less Performant Over Time {#cleanup}
<!--DOCS-1183-->
When the Compute Service deletes an entity, such as an instance, it *marks* the relevant database rows as deleted, but does not actually *remove* those rows from the database. As the number of "soft-deleted" rows builds up, they begin to have a significantly detrimental impact on the database's performance.

When a row is marked as "deleted", two values are set.

- The `deleted_at` column is set to the date and time that the deletion occurred. 
- The `deleted` column is set to a non-zero value. (The value of the row's `id` column.)

The following SQL statements use these two markers to identify and remove database rows related to deleted entities.

1. Set the date and time to use for deletions. **Note**: All database rows pertaining to entities deleted *before* this date will be deleted. 
		
		set @keep_date = '2015-04-01 00:00';

1. Repeat the following statement until a small number of rows are deleted. 
 
		delete from reservations where deleted != 0 limit 10000;

2. Repeat the following statement until a small number of rows are updated.

		update task_log as t set t.deleted = t.id, t.deleted_at = UTC_TIMESTAMP() where t.created_at < @keep_date and t.deleted = 0 LIMIT 10000;set foreign_key_checks=0;set tx_isolation='read-uncommitted';

4. Repeat the following three statements until the number of rows selected is small.
 
		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inst_uuids as (select i.uuid, i.deleted_at from instances as i, block_device_mapping as u where i.uuid = u.instance_uuid and i.deleted != 0 and u.deleted = 0) limit 10000; 
		update block_device_mapping as t, inst_uuids as i set t.deleted = t.id, t.deleted_at = i.deleted_at where t.instance_uuid = i.uuid;
		drop table inst_uuids;

5. Delete rows that have been "soft deleted" prior to `keep_date`.
 
		delete from aggregate_hosts where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from aggregate_metadata where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from aggregates where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from compute_nodes  where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from services where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_groups where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_group_member where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_group_policy where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from task_log where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from key_pairs where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from quotas where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from quota_usages where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from volume_usage_cache where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instances where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_faults where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_metadata where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from block_device_mapping where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_id_mappings where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_actions where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_actions_events where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_info_caches where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;
		delete from instance_system_metadata where deleted != 0 and deleted_at < @keep_date limit 10000;

6. Repeat the following three statements until the number of rows selected is small.
 
		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inst_uuids as (select u.id from block_device_mapping as u where u.instance_uuid not in (select uuid from instances where uuid u.instance_uuid)) limit 10000;
		delete u from block_device_mapping u, inst_uuids i where i.id = u.id;
		drop table inst_uuids;

7. Repeat the following three statements until the number of rows selected is small.
 
		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inst_uuids as (select u.id from instance_actions as u where u.instance_uuid not in (select uuid from instances where uuid = u.instance_uuid)) limit 10000;
		delete u from instance_actions u, inst_uuids i where i.id = u.id;
		drop table inst_uuids;</pre>

8. Repeat the following three statements until the number of rows selected is small.

		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inst_uuids as (select u.id from instance_system_metadata as u where u.instance_uuid not in (select uuid from instances where uuid = u.instance_uuid)) limit 10000;
		delete u from instance_system_metadata u, inst_uuids i where i.id = u.id;
		drop table inst_uuids;

8. Repeat the following three statements until the number of rows selected is small.
 
		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inst_uuids as (select u.id from volume_usage_cache as u where u.instance_uuid not in (select uuid from instances where uuid = u.instance_uuid)) limit 10000;
		delete u from volume_usage_cache u, inst_uuids i where i.id = u.id;
		drop table inst_uuids;

9. Repeat the following three statements until the number of rows selected is small. 

		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inst_uuids as (select u.id from instance_id_mappings as u where u.uuid not in (select uuid from instances where uuid = u.uuid)) limit 10000;
		delete u from instance_id_mappings u, inst_uuids i where i.id = u.id;
		drop table inst_uuids;

10. Repeat the following three statements until the number of rows selected is small.

		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inst_uuids as (select u.id from instance_actions_events as u where u.action_id not in (select id from instance_actions where id = u.action_id)) limit 10000;
		delete u from instance_actions_events u, inst_uuids i where i.id = u.id;
		drop table inst_uuids;
