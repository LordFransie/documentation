# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade: Managing Projects #

You can manage access to projects by assigning users and setting primary projects. You can also control resources by managing operational quotas.

### Creating projects

As an admin, you can use create projects and allow specific users to access each project:

* [Create and delete projects](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/projects/creating/)
* [View details on a project](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/projects/viewing/)
* [Add and remove users to a project](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/projects/users/)

### Managing quotas 

Quotas are operational limits that you can configure to prevent system capacities from being exhausted without notification. 

Use the **Identity** panel on the **Admin** dashboard to set maximum limits for metadata, instances, CPUs, memory, and other settings for each project.

* [Modify the quota of a project](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/projects/quotas/)
