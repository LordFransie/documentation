# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade: Using as an Admin User

The Admin dashboard enables you to work within the current cloud domain. You can access tools to work with the Compute, Network, Object Operations, and Orchestration services.

As an administrator (admin), you can perform all of the [user tasks](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/nonadmin/) in addition to the admin tasks.

### Managing Domains ###

A domain is a high-level container for projects, users, and groups that defines administrative boundaries for management of those entities. A domain can represent an individual, company, or operator owned space. 

You can manage:

* flavors
* images
* quotas
* host aggregates
* services

For more information, see [Managing Domains](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/domains/).
