# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade: Protecting Images

A virtual machine image is a single file that contains a virtual disk with a bootable operating system installed on it. You can use images to create virtual machine instances within the cloud. 

If you want to prevent an image from being deleted, you can make that image *protected*. 

### Protect an image ###

1. [Launch the HP Helion OpenStack Helion Dashboard](/helion/openstack/1.1/dashboard/login/).

2. Click the **Images** link on the **Project** dashboard **Compute** panel.

3. In the **Images** screen, for the image you want to protect, click the arrow icon in the **Actions** menu and select **Edit**.

4. In the **Update Image** screen, select **Protected**.

5. Click **Update Image**.

The image is protected and the **Delete Image** command is removed from the **More** menu.
