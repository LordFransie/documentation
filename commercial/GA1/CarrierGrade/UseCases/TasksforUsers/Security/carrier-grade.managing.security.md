# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade: Managing Security

HP Helion OpenStack uses security groups and security rules to control access to instances in your cloud.

You can use the dashboards to create, delete and configure security groups and security group rules to control access to your instance

How you interact with your network environment depends upon your user type, either an administrative user (admin) or a non-administrative user (user). 

**Note:** The admin can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.

## Managing security as a user ##

As a user, you can work with the security groups and rules in the active project.

Access the security commands using the Compute panel on the Project dashboard. 

Click Access &amp; Security to work with security groups and rules to perform the following tasks:

* [Create a security group](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/security/groups/)
* [Create security group rules](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/security/groups/)
* [Managing Key Pairs](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/security/keypairs/)

## Managing security as an admin ##

As an admin user, you can work on all of the security groups in your domain, regardless of which project the group is associated with. 

<!-- Remove this? Covered under Manage Roles. Not yet in beta
### Managing Users in Domain ###

* Manage role assignment for Users to Projects
