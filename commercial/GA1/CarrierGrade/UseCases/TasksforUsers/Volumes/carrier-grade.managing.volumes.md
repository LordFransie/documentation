# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Carrier Grade: Managing Block Storage Volumes

Volumes are block storage devices that allow you to expand the storage capacity of an instance. Volumes may only be attached to one server at a time, and will retain data, even when not attached to an instance.

You can create and configure volumes; create snapshots of volumes; update the metadata associated with a volume, extend volumes, and transfer a volume between users, and attach and detach volumes from instances.

How you interact with these images depends upon your user type, either an administrative user (admin) or a non-administrative user (user). 

## Managing volumes as a user ##

As a user, you can work with any volume associated with the active project. 

* [Create, edit and delete a volume](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/volume/create/)
* [Create a snapshot from a volume](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/volume/snapshot/create/)
* [Extend the size of a volume](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/volume/extend/)
* [Attach a volume to a VM instance and detach a volume from VM instance](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/volume/attach/)

## Managing volumes as an admin ##

**Note:** The administrative user can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.

* [Creating and deleting a volume type](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/volume/admin/)
