# HP Helion OpenStack&reg;: Deploying and Configuring OVSvApp on ESX hosts 
HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) is an enhanced Networking Operations (Neutron) service module of HP Helion OpenStack that delivers network virtualization to orchestrate your data center infrastructure.

The HP Virtual Cloud Networking Open vSwitch vApp (OVSvApp) appliance must be installed on each ESX hypervisor in the HP Helion OpenStack environment to provision VMs in your VMware vCenter environment. Once deployed, the OVSvApp enables networking between the tenant Virtual Machines (VMs).

The deployment process includes the following basic steps:

1. Uploading the OVSvApp file to one of the ESX hosts in your data center.
2. Adding your settings to the configuration file so that the OVSvApp deployment script can clone the file on each host being managed by the overcloud controller.
3. Running the deployment script.

The following topics in this section explain how to deploy and verify deployment of OVSvApp for VCN on ESX hosts.

* [Prerequisites](#prereqs)
* [Deploying the OVSvApp](#deploytemplate)
* [Verifying your deployment](#deploymentverification)
* [Managing the HP VCN networking service](#managevcnnetworkservice)
* [Troubleshooting OVSvApp](#trouble)
* [Uninstalling VCN on ESX hosts](#uninstallvcn)
* [Next Steps](#next)

## Prerequisites<a name="prereqs"></a>

Before you install the OVSvApp, ensure the following:

- The HP Helion OpenStack must be installed and configured.

- The VMware vSphere&reg; platform must be installed and configured.

- The vCenter server must be reachable from the server where OVSvApp VM installation is launched. 

- Unset the `https_proxy` environment variable on the server where OVSvApp VM deployment will be launched, using the following command:

	unset https_proxy

- The two Virtual Distributed Switches (VDS) must be configured. 

	- **Automatic DVS configuration:** If the `is_auto_dvs` value in the `ovs_vapp.ini` file is set to true, the VDS will be configured during the deployment. Automatic configuration requires ESX 5.1 or greater.
		
	- **Manual DVS configuration:** If the `is_auto_dvs` value in the `ovs_vapp.ini` file is set to false, you need to create and configure the VDS as given below. Manual configuration requires ESX 5.0.0 or greater.

		There must be two Virtual Distributed Switches (VDS) and they are configured as follows: 

    	**vDS1**: This switch has no uplink ports configured and has a portgroup of type **VLAN** with **Trunking enabled**. The switch must contain the list of VLAN tags that are used by overcloud Networking Operations (Neutron) service. The **Promiscuous Mode** and **Forged Transmits** options must be set to **Accept** under the **Security** tab for the **Portgroup**.	

    	**Note**: The name of VLAN trunk portgroup must be associated with `trunk_interface` parameter in the `ovs_vapp.ini`. You will create the INI file in [Modify and execute the installer](#modify).
    
		**vDS2**: This switch should have an uplink port connecting to the overcloud baremetal network. Two portgroups should be available for this switch â€“ management, data.  Management portgroup handles the management traffic and may or may not be not configured for VLAN. 

		The data portgroup should be of type VLAN with `Trunking enabled`. It should contain the list of VLAN tags that are used by overcloud Networking Operations service. The **Promiscuous Mode** and **Forged Transmits** options should be set to **Accept** under the **Security** tab for the data portgroup.
		
		**Note**: You will need this information for a configuration file, `ovs_vapp.ini`. The management portgroup must be associated with the `mgmt_interface parameter` and the data portgroup must be associated with `data_interface` parameter in the `ovs_vapp.ini`. You will create the INI file in [Modify and execute the installer](#modify).

	Example:

		vDS1  - trunk portgroup name - vlan_trunk
		vDS2 
			a. Portgroup1  name-mgmt
			b. Portgroup2 name-data

		Changes in ovs_vapp.ini for the above values
		
		[network]
	
		data_interface={'vmxnet3':'data'}
		mgmt_interface={'vmxnet3':'mgmt'}
		trunk_interface={'vmxnet3':'vlan_trunk'}

### Notes for deploying OVSvApp VM onto ESX hypervisors ### {#esx}

* The ESX version required depends upon how VDS is deployed, as described in [Prerequisites](#prereqs}.

* The OVSvApp appliance supports ESX hosts with version 5.1.0 or greater. Please make sure that ESX host does not have another iteration of the OVSvApp already deployed. 

* The ESX host must be reachable from the server where OVSvApp VM installation is launched. The ipaddress of the ESX hosts should be the same ipaddress with which the vCenter server manages that host. For more information see [Preparing the network for an ESX installation](/helion/openstack/ga/install/prereqs/#network_prepare) in *Prerequisites*. 

- All ESX hosts must have synchronized time settings. If hosts have different time, the deployment will fail.

- Use the vShpere client to select **Disable: Allow VM power on operations that violate availability constraints** as a part of cluster settings, as shaown. If not, ESX host might hang at 2% during transition to maintenance mode. 

	<img src="media/OVSvApp_all_vm_power.png">

- 	If DVS will be configured automatically (`is_auto_dvs = True`) the installer requires one physical NIC name as input. This physical NIC must be unused(not part of any VSS or VDS) and its name should be same across all ESX hosts within a datacenter. 

- The traffic between two tenant VMs on the same network and on the same ESX Compute host cannot be blocked. If custom security groups are used, add explicit security group rules to allow traffic between the VMs, regardless of the compute host they are provisioned on . Using rules to allow traffic will help maintain VM connectivity.



##Deploying the OVSvApp<a name="deploytemplate"></a>

You must upload the OVSvApp appliance to one of the ESX hosts that is hosting VMs provisioned from HP Helion OpenStack environment. You must then configure the settings in the configuration file. The file can be used to clone and deploy OVSvApp on each host being managed by the controller.

The deploy process installs the OVSvApp as a virtual machine, which is referred to as *OVSvApp VM* in this document.

**Note**

* The OVSvApp VMs must be installed on each ESX hypervisor. 
* IP address are assigned to the OVSvApp VMs manually. The Administrator must keep a separate pool of IP addresses from the management VLAN to be assigned to the OVSvApp VMs. These IP addresses must be assigned to the Ethernet interfaces connecting to **Management Port Group**.
* The management portgroup for OVSvApp VM must be different than the Compute proxy management portgroup.
* Specify distributed virtual switch (VDS) ports in the `ovs_vapp.ini`. Make sure the VDS ports are attached with the proper hosts.

### Create a VM template in vCenter

The first step in deploying the OVSvApp is to create a VM template that will make it easier to deploy the OVSvApp on each ESX hypervisor.

To deploy the OVSvApp:

1. Create a directory `/ovsvapp` on any server in the Helion environment and upload `ovsvapp.tgz`. Extract the `ovsvapp.tgz` and locate the `hp-ovsvapp` directory. In the directory, locate  `overcloud_esx_ovsvapp.ova`. This is the OVSvApp appliance.

2. Use the vSphere client to upload the `overcloud_esx_ovsvapp.ova` file to one of the ESX hosts in your data center: 

	a. In the vSphere Client, click **File > Deploy OVF Template**.

	b. Follow the instructions in the wizard that displays to specify the data center, cluster, and node to install onto. Refer to the VMWare vSphere documentation, as needed.

	The installer creates the OVSvApp appliance (VM) on the specified node. The appliance is listed in the left column of vCenter, by default named `overcloud-esx-ovsvapp-(build number)`.

3. Add a **CD-ROM** device to the OVSvApp appliance using the vCenter. 

	a. In the vSphere Client, right-click the OVSvApp appliance.

	b. Click **Edit Settings**.	

	c. Select the **Hardware** tab and click **Add**.

	d. Select **DVD/CD-ROM Drive**.

	e. Follow the instructions in the wizard that displays.

	Refer to the VMWare vSphere documentation, as needed.

4. Enable the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI), a high-speed communication channel between a virtual machine and the ESX hypervisor.

	a. On the **Hardware** tab, select **Enable VMCI Between VMs**. The **Hardware** tab should be open from the previous step.

	b. Click **OK**.

5. Power on the OVSvApp appliance using vCenter. The default credentials to login to the OVSvApp appliance are `stack/stack`. 

6. Install the VMWare tools in the OVSvApp appliance: 
	
	a.In the vSphere Client, right-click the OVSvApp appliance.

	b. Select **Guest > Install/Upgrade VMware Tools**. 

7. Launch the OVSvApp appliance console to install the VMware Tools from command line terminal: 

	a. Right-click the OVSvApp appliance and select **Open Console**.

	b. Enter the following commands:

		sudo su
		mkdir /mnt/vmware-tools
		mount /dev/cdrom/ /mnt/vmware-tools
		cp -f /mnt/vmware-tools/VMwareTools-*.tar.gz /tmp/
		cd /tmp
		tar -zxpf VMwareTools-*.tar.gz
		cd /vmware-tools-distrib
		./vmware-tools-install.pl  --default

	Verify that VMWare Tools is running using the following command: 

		service vmware-tools status

	Do not proceed with the installation if VMWare Tools is not running.


8. When the installation completes, shutdown the OVSvApp appliance.

9. Disable the VMCI: 

	a. Right-click the OVSvApp appliance. 

	b.  Click **Edit Settings**.	

	c. Remove the CD/DVD drive.

	d. Clear the **Enable VMCI between VMs** option.

### Install the prerequisite python libraries

On the server where you extracted the `ovsvapp.tgz` file, install the prerequisite python libraries:

1.	Install [pyvmomi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvmomi).

2.	Install [netaddr](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netaddr).

### Modify and execute the installer {#modify}

On the server where you extracted the `ovsvapp.tgz` file, locate the `ovs_vapp.ini` file.

1. Modify the `ovs_vapp.ini` file by adding settings for cloning and configuring OVSvApp VMs: 

	a. Locate the `ovs_vapp.ini` file in the `/ovsvapp/hp-ovsvapp/conf` directory.
	
	b. Add VMware settings.

		#Provide the template/appliance name that will be used for cloning
		template_name=overcloud-esx-ovsvapp

	e. Specify a name, the number of CPUs, and the amount of RAM  for the deployed OVSvApp.

    **Note**: During deployment, the `ovs_vm_name` setting is appended with each VM host name and IP address to appear as `<ovs_vm_name>_<IP>`.
	
		[vmconfig]
		#The deployed ovsvapp name. It will be appended with esxi hostname. And will look like <ovs_vm_name>_<vm_ip>
		ovs_vm_name=ovsvapp_prefix_name
		
		#Number of CPUs for the OVSvApp VM

		#Maintenance mode will trigger DRS to migrate the tenant VMS. If set to false, then esx host will be shut down along with all tenant VMs. (*OPTIONAL)
		esx_maintenance_mode=true_or_false

	**Note:** The agent monitoring module monitors the OVSvApp agent and takes the following action when OVSvApp VMâ€™s kernel panic occurs. 

	- If set to true, the ESX host is put in Maintenance Mode.  
	- If set to false, the ESX host will be shut down along with all tenant VMs.

	i. Specify the level for logging errors, and a log file location. Default file location is:`/var/log/ovsvapp_log`.

		log_level=DEBUG_or_INFO

3. Invoke the installer using the following commands:

		sudo su
		cd /hp-ovsvapp/src/ovsvm/
		python  invoke_vapp_installer.py

	The installation log file will be located at `/hp-ovsvapp/log/ovs_vapp.log`.

## Verifying your deployment<a name="deploymentverification"></a>

After the OVSvApp deployment script executes successfully, you can see the OVSvApp deployed on all the specified ESX hosts. 

1. Login to the overcloud controller from the seed VM host:  

		ssh heat-admin@<ip overcloud controller>

2. Switch to root.
 
3. Enter the following command.

		source /root/stackrc
	
4. Enter the following command.
 
		neutron agent-list 
	
5. For all the HP VCN L2 agents check whether agent alive status is **:-)**. If  the status is **xxx** for an agent then login to that OVSvApp using SSH Key provided in ovs_vapp.ini file, restart the `hpvcn-neutron-agent` using the following command:

		sudo service hpvcn-neutron-agent restart 

6. Re-verify the agent reporting in the overcloud controller by running the following command.

		neutron agent-list

    All agents should indicate alive status that is denoted by**:-)**.


## Managing HP VCN networking <a name="managevcnnetworkservice"></a>

Enter the following commands to stop and restart the HP VCN networking service (`hpvcn-neutron-agent`):

	sudo service hpvcn-neutron-agent stop
	sudo service hpvcn-neutron-agent start

## Troubleshooting OVSvApp ## {#trouble}

If you are having issues with the installation or operation of the OVSvApp, review these tips:

- During installation of OVSvApp VMs on a large scale, OVSvApp VM can hang and installation might not proceed. If this happens, execute the `neutron agent list` command. If the output shows a OVSvApp VM in the `xxx` agent state, rerun the installation for that specific failed OVSvApp VM by specifying the ESX host name in the `new_hosts` field under the `new-host-addition` section of the `ovs_vapp.ini` file.

- In a multiple vCenter environment, during tenant VMs spawn, if a VM fails to spawn on one vCenter server and successfully spawns on another vCenter server, check for stale portgroups, which causes stale OVS Flows. If an OVSvApp agent needs to be restarted, the OVS flows might be slow to be restored. If that happens, restart the agent to stabilize the flows.

- If DRS and HA are enabled on the cluster, tenant VMs except OVSvApp VM will migrate to other ESX hosts.

	If the `neutron agent list` command shows a specific OVSvApp agent up and running, but ESX maintenance mode is launched, you can disable agent monitoring for the OVSvApp solution. To disable agent monitoring, add a flag `enable_agent_monitor = false` in the `/etc/neuton/neutron.conf` file. Restart the server to take effect.

- If you experience issues while installing the VMWare Tools, try any of the following references for help:

	For any issues while installing VMware Tools: 
	<br>	[VMware Knowledge Base](http://kb.vmware.com/) 
	<br>	[VMware Support](https://www.vmware.com/support/vsphere/) 

- For any Operating System related issues:
<br>	[hLinux Bugzilla](http://hlinux-home.usa.hp.com/bugzilla/) 

- In a scalable environment, portgroups might not get deleted when the `nova delete` command is run.


## Uninstalling OVSvApp VM on ESX hosts<a name="uninstallvcn"></a>

To uninstall VCN on ESX hosts, access the ESX hosts from vSphere Client, and delete each OVSvApp VM.

## Next Steps<a name="next"></a>

- Deploy vCenter ESX Compute proxy manually **(REQUIRED)**

	If you have not deployed the vCenter ESX compute proxy, see [HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Deploy vCenter ESX compute proxy](/helion/openstack/ga/install/esx/proxy/).

- Install DNS as a service (DNSaaS) (Optional).

	If you have not installed DNSaaS, see [DNSaaS Beta Installation and Configuration](/helion/openstack/install/dnsaas/).

	DNSaaS is our managed DNS service, based on the OpenStack Designate project, is engineered to help you create, publish, and manage your DNS zones and records securely and efficiently to either a public or private DNS server network.
