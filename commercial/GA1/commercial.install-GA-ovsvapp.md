# HP Helion OpenStack&reg;: Deploying and configuring OVSvApp on ESXi hosts 

HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) is an enhanced networking (Neutron) module of HP Helion OpenStack that delivers network virtualization to orchestrate your data center infrastructure.

HP Virtual Cloud Networking's Open vSwitch vApp (OVSvApp) must be installed for HP Helion OpenStack environment to provision VMs in your VMware vCenter environment. Once deployed, OVSvApp appliance enables networking between the tenant Virtual Machines (VMs).

The deployment process includes the following basic steps:

1. Uploading the OVSvApp appliance file to one of the ESXi hosts in your data center.The ESXi host is the system where ESX is installed.
2. Adding your settings to the configuration file so that the OVSvAPP deployment script can clone the file on each host being managed by the overcloud controller.
3. Running the deployment script.

The following topics in this section explain how to deploy and verify deployment of OVSvApp for VCN on ESXi hosts.

* [Prerequisites](#prereqs)
* [Deploying the OVSvAPP appliance](#deploytemplate)
* [Verifying your deployment](#deploymentverification)
* [Managing the HP VCN networking service](#managevcnnetworkservice)
* [Uninstalling VCN on ESXi hosts](#uninstallvcn)

## Prerequisites ## {#prereqs}

Before you install the OVSvApp appliance, ensure the following:

* The HP Helion Openstack must be installed and configured.

* The VMware vSphere&reg; platform must be installed and configured.

* Two specific networks must be installed and configured for the VMware vCenter environment. The network is used for communication between specific aspects of vCenterL - the OVSvApp communicates with the Neutron message queue. For more information see [Preparing the network for an ESX installation](/helion/openstack/ga/install/prereqs/#network_prepare) in *Before you begin*. 

* The VMware cluster has two Virtual Distributed Switches (vDS) and they  are configured as follows: 

    **vDS1**: This switch has no uplink ports configured on it and has a portgroup of type **VLAN** with **Trunking enabled**. It should contain the list of VLAN tags that are used by OverCloud Neutron service. The **Promiscuous Mode** and **Forged Transmits** options should be set to **Accept** under the **Security** Tab of the **Portgroup**.	


      <!---***DVS1***: It should be created without any uplinks. Create a trunk portgroup with VLAN type as **VLAN Trunking** and specify the VLAN trunk range pertaining to the environment. Enable **Promiscuous Mode** and **Forged Transmits** in the portgroup security settings.-->

    **Note**: The name of VLAN trunk portgroup must be associated with `trunk_interface` parameter in the `ovs_vapp.ini` . 
    
    **vDS2**: This switch should have an uplink port/ports connecting to the OverCloud Baremetal Network. Two portgroups should be available for this switch. One of the portgroups (management) handles the management traffic and is not configured for VLAN.The other portgroup (data) should be of type VLAN with `Trunking enabled`. It should contain the list of VLAN tags that are used by OverCloud Neutron service. The **Promiscuous Mode** and **Forged Transmits** options should be set to **Accept** under the **Security** Tab of the **Portgroup**.

    <!---***DVS2***: It should be created with uplink to the management interface and/or data interface. The following two portgroups must be created in DVS2:
  
    * Create first portgroup with VLAN type as **None**. This is used for management traffic.

    *  Create second portgroup with VLAN type as **VLAN Trunking** and specify the VLAN trunk range pertaining to the environment. This is used for data traffic. Enable **Promiscuous Mode** and **Forged Transmits** in the portgroup security settings.-->

    **Note**: The name of the first portgroup must be associated with `mgmt_interface` parameter and name of the second portgroup must be associated with `data_interface` parameter in the `ovs_vapp.ini`. 

Example:

	DVS1  - trunk portgroup name - vlan_trunk
	DVS2- Portgroup1  name- mgmt
	Portgroup2 name- data

	Changes in ovs_vapp.ini for the above values
	
	[network]

	data_interface={'vmxnet3':'data'}
	mgmt_interface={'vmxnet3':'mgmt'}
	trunk_interface={'vmxnet3':'vlan_trunk'}

		esx_maintenance_mode=True
	
		[logger]
		#Log level. Such as DEBUG, INFO
		log_level=DEBUG

11. Invoke the installer using the following commands:

	cd /hp-ovsvapp/src/ovsvm/
	python invoke_vapp_installer.py

	The installation log file will be located at `/hp-ovsvapp/log/ovs_vapp.log`

##Verifying your deployment {#deploymentverification}

After the OVSvApp deployment script is run successfully, you can see the OVSvApp appliance deployed on all the specified ESXi hosts. 

1. Login to the overcloud controller from the Seed:  

         ssh heat-admin@<ip overcloud controller>

2. Switch to root.
 
3. Enter the following command.

        source /root/stackrc
	
4. Enter the following command.
 
         neutron agent-list 
	
5. For all the HP VCN L2 agents check whether agent alive status is **:-)**. If  the status is **xxx** for an agent then login to that OVSvApp appliance using credentials stack/stack, restart the hpvcn agent using the following command

        sudo service hpvcn-neutron-agent restart 

6. Re-verify the agent reporting in the overcloud controller by running the following command.

        neutron agent-list

    All agents should indicate alive status that is denoted by**:-)**.

	<!---After the OVSvApp deployment script is run successfully, you can see the OVSvApp VMs deployed on all the specified ESXi hosts. Perform the following steps to verify the deployment:

1. On one of the ESXi hosts, log on to the deployed OVSvApp VM using the credentials `stack/stack`.

2. Run the following command:

		`sudo service hpvcn-neutron-agent status'

	A message similar to the following confirms that the OVSvApp deployment is successful.

	`hpvcn-neutron-agent start/running, process 4835`

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to verify the deployment of the OVSvApp VMs on the other ESXi hosts you specified in the `ovs_vapp.ini` file. 

4. (Optional) To verify that configuration on each OVSvApp VM is successful, review the following files on each VM.

	*  `/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`
	*  `/etc/neutron/plugins/hp/hpvcn_neutron_agent.ini`-->


##Managing the HP VCN networking service {#managevcnnetworkservice}

You must stop and restart the HP VCN networking service to reload the changes you made during
your OVSvApp deployment. 

Enter the following commands to stop and restart the HP VCN networking service:

* `sudo service hpvcn-neutron-agent stop`

* `sudo service hpvcn-neutron-agent start`


##Uninstalling VCN on ESXi hosts {#uninstallvcn}

To uninstall VCN on ESXi hosts, access the ESXi hosts from vSphere Client, and delete each OVSvApp VM.

<!--- Removed from after step 8, In the Seed VM's folder /ovsvapp/hp-ovsvapp/src/ovsvm....
5. Install `pyvmomi` and `netaddr python` modules on the machine from where you  run the installer script, using the following command.

    `pip install pyvmomi`

    `pip install netaddr`

6. In the `hp-ovsvapp\src\ovsvm` folder, locate the `ovs_vapp.ini` file, and add your settings for cloning and configuring OVSvApp VMs.

**Note**: It is important that you carefully enter and verify the settings you add to the file because the configuration in the `ovs_vapp.ini` file is deployed to multiple OVSvApp VMs. -->
