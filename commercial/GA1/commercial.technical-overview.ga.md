## Network architecture {#networkarch}

The following information describes the network configuration for the [physical networks](#physical) and [virtual networks](#virtual), which must be configured by the network administrator.

### Physical network architecture {#physical}

This table provides an overview of the physical network configuration requirements you must meet, with the following assumptions:

- Physical network ports on each server
	- One IPMI port
	- One physical ethernet port (for example, eth0) for the hypervisor/OS

- Network fabric
	- Two physical links, one for IPMI and one for the hypervisor/OS
	- Network switches capable of basic VLAN, L2 and L3 functions;
	- The physical hypervisor/OS network is shared by a number of logical networks, and each logical network has its own VLAN and IP subnet

For detailed information, see the [Preparing the network](/helion/openstack/install/prereqs/#network) section of the *Prerequisites*.

## Network planning {#networkplan}

You must manage and prepare the network based on the type of hypervisor.
 
For more details information on network planning see [Preparing your network](/helion/openstack/install/prereqs/).  

### Network security {#networksecurity}

The Network Administrator must set up routing and firewalls for tenants to access service APIs which are only exposed on the management network. For more information on guidelines for setting up security firewalls and routing see [Network security]( /helion/openstack/install/security/).

<!---

The physical machines need to have their management processors (iLO) connected to a network that is reachable from the Seed VM. The physical machines and the Seed VM need to be connected to a fast network.
We recommend using one physical Ethernet port on a 10 GB network. Use an untagged VLAN for this network. 

The Seed VM is expected to use eth0 to connect to the cluster network (and hence through to the management network). If your host uses another NIC, for example eth1, then you need to set the environment variable appropriately, for example BRIDGE_INTERFACE=eth1, as seen by root.

#### Network fabric 
* Two physical links, one for IPMI/iLO and one for the hypervisor/OS
* Network switches capable of basic VLAN, L2 and L3 functions (there is no dependency on VxLAN-capable or OpenFlow-enabled switch, although the product supports VxLAN as the virtual/overlay network)

The physical cluster network can be shared by a number of logical networks, each with its own tagged VLAN and IP subnet. We recommend using at least one such network as the external network, with floating IPs coming from its subnet range. --->

## Installation planning {#install-configure}

HP Helion OpenStack uses three linked installation phases, called OpenStack-on-OpenStack (TripleO), to deploy a complete OpenStack cloud. TripleO simulates the deployment of OpenStack by creating and configuring baremetal servers to successfully run a cloud deployment.

TripleO is OpenStack's official project for deployment, configuration, and life cycle management of OpenStack clouds. A TripleO installation includes a seed, undercloud and overcloud:

[Learn more]( /helion/openstack/install/overview/) about installing and configuring HP Helion OpenStack. 

### Installation options {#install-option}

HP Helion OpenStack is provided with two baremetal installation options depending on your system configuration.  It allows you to manage the KVM and ESX hypervisors and provision virtual machines. 
 

#### KVM Hypervisor with HP StoreVirtual VSA support {#kvm-Hypervisor}

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a virtualization infrastructure for the Linux kernel, which turns it into a hypervisor. KVM requires a processor with hardware virtualization extension.

HP Helion OpenStack architecture diagram for KVM network architecture.

<img src="media/topology_kvm.png"/)>

HP StoreVirtual VSA Software is a Virtual Storage Appliance that provides the complete array functionality on top of Linux KVM environment without external hardware. VSA eliminates the need for external shared storage required to implement Block Storage features. VSA uses scale-out, distributed clustering to provide a pool of storage with enterprise storage features and simple management at a reduced cost.

HP Helion OpenStack architecture diagram for Store Virtual volume type mapping

<img src="media/reference-architecture-StoreVirtual-volume-type-mapping.png"/> 

**Note:** Your HP Helion OpenStack installation can be configured [to use 3Par for block storage](/helion/openstack/install/3par/).

#### ESX Hypervisor with HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) application support {#esx-hypervisor}

HP Helion OpenStack supports VMWare ESX hypervisor. With our ESX integration, you can provision and manage an overcloud ESX cluster. VMWare vCenter Compute driver is used as a part of ESX integration. The VMware vCenter driver connects to ESX clusters in a vCenter through Compute proxy nodes. A Compute node scheduler sees each cluster as compute and uses the same for scheduling a new instances.

An ESX Proxy Compute driver communicates to VMware vCenter server through VI SDK. All the details of vCenter in the Cloud Controller  are required to be captured. The EON service sub-component, captures details of the vCenter server in a Cloud Controller and provides the details of the clusters for configuring the list of clusters managed by ESX Proxy Compute node. 
 
The ESX integration uses the OVSvApp application to connect the vCenter networking to the Network Operations controller to manage workload networks.  

HP Helion OpenStack architecture diagram for ESX 
<img src="media/commercial_esx_network_architecture.png"/>

The HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) application is an enhanced Networking Operations (Neutron) module of HP Helion OpenStack that delivers network virtualization to orchestrate your data center infrastructure.

HP VCN enables you to build a robust, multi-tenant networking infrastructure that delivers ready-to-use compute, storage, and networking by providing;

* Scalable, secure, and hardened enterprise cloud networking
* Automated delivery of secure isolated networks in minutes  

#### DNS as a service (DNSaaS) {#DNSaaS}

After installing HP Helion OpenStack, you have the option to install HP Helion OpenStack DNS as a service (DNSaaS) support. The HP Helion OpenStack DNS (Domain Name System) service, based on the OpenStack Designate project, is a managed DNS service engineered to help you create, publish, and manage your DNS zones and records securely and efficiently to either a public or private DNS server network.

[Learn more]( /helion/openstack/install/dnsaas/) about DNSaaS installation and configuration.

<!---
Currently, supported DNS servers and networks include: 

* PowerDNS--->

## High availability {#highavailability}

The HP Helion OpenStack High Availability (HA) architecture ensures that cloud resources are always available on request, resulting in uninterrupted operations for users. 

The OpenStack services are deployed in a three node Controller cluster, which ensures availability of stateless services like API services and stateful services like MySQL or RabbitMQ.

For more details on HA configuration, refer to [HP Helion OpenStack High Availability](/helion/openstack/high-availability/) and [OpenStack HA Guide](http://docs.openstack.org/high-availability-guide/content/index.html).

<a href="#top" style="padding:14px 0px 14px 0px; text-decoration: none;"> Return to Top &#8593; </a>

## Updates and extensions {#updates-and-extensions}

Updates and extensions provides a mechanism to download and install the content and updates for the overcloud.

For more information refer
[Updates and extension](/helion/openstack/undercloud/admin/updates-and-extension/).

<a href="#top" style="padding:14px 0px 14px 0px; text-decoration: none;"> Return to Top &#8593; </a>

## Operational management {#operate-manage}

The following systems help you manage your cloud services.

### Centralized Logging {#centralized-logging}

Centralized logging is based on <a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a>, <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>, and <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/kibana/current/_dashboard_schema.html">Kibana Dashboard</a> which is deployed in the undercloud server. 

Centralized logging helps the administrator triage and troubleshoot the distributed cloud deployment from the undercloud. The user is not required to access the  several remote server (SSH) to view the individual log files.

### Monitoring {#monitoring}

The administrator can monitor the availability of all hosts and services in the overcloud using the <a href="https://www.icinga.org/">Icinga Monitoring server</a> deployed in the undercloud.

System and service health checks are based on the **check_mk** framework. Health checks are executed locally on each node, and their results are sent over to the central Icinga server, thereby distributing the processing and allowing the Icinga server to scale up. When new nodes are added to the cloud, they are automatically discovered and monitored.

For more information refer to [Monitoring](/helion/openstack/services/object/swift/Monitor-cluster/).


### Add, remove and replace nodes {#add-remove-replace-nodes}

HP Helion OpenStack provides automation scripts to add capacity to the cloud for compute, storage, and networking. 

You can prepare hardware servers and incrementally deploy HP Compute nodes, HP StoreVirtual VSA Block Storage nodes, and OpenStack Swift Proxy and Object Storage nodes.

Conversely, you can decommission servers and remove specific nodes from the cloud.

If any of the controller nodes fails, you can remove and replace controller nodes, while re-connecting them automatically into the HA cluster. 

For more information on adding (Scale Out) or removing (Scale In) nodes (KVM Compute Nodes) to an already-installed overcloud on a KVM hypervisor, see [HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Add (Scale-Out) and Remove (Scale-In) Nodes on KVM Hypervisors](/helion/openstack/install/add/nodes/).

### Backup and Restore nodes {#backup-restore-nodes}

Backup and restore scripts and procedures are provided for the seed VM, undercloud, overcloud management controller (running singleton services like Sherpa), and the MySQL database deployed in the controller cluster. These scripts are to be used by administrators managing the OpenStack Cloud.

Backup and Restore of VM instances/snapshots and volumes/snapshots for workloads in the cloud is supported using the Object Storage service.

 For more information see [HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Back Up and Restore](/helion/openstack/backup.restore/)
