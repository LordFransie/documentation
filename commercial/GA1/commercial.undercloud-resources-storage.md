# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Working with Storage

The **Storage** option under the **Resources** Tab allows you to configure storage for your cloud. This allows you to add your HP StoreVirtual Clusters and HP 3PAR StoreServ to the cloud inventory. You can then use the **Configure** option under the **Overcloud** Tab to add the registered resources to the overcloud.  

The Storage option has two sub options:

* [StoreVirtual](/helion/openstack/undercloud/storage/storevirtual/)
* [StoreServ](/helion/openstack/undercloud/storage/storeserv/)
