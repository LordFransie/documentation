# HP Helion OpenStack&reg; Ironic Service Overview#

HP Helion OpenStack leverages the OpenStack Ironic service during the installation for provisioning of the controller and KVM compute host in a baremetal deployment.

Ironic is an OpenStack service to provision baremetal, not virtual, machines by leveraging common technologies such as PXE boot and IPMI to cover a wide range of hardware. Supporting pluggable drivers allows vendor-specific functionality to be added.
