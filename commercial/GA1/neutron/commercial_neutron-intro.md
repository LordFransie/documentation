# HP Helion OpenStack&reg; 1.1 Networking Operation (Neutron) Administrator Pre and Post Installation Tasks

Helion Network Administrators are responsible for planning for the Neutron networking service, and once installed, to configure the service to meet the needs of their cloud network users. This guide explains the tasks that the Helion OpenStack network administrator must complete to have a properly functioning cloud network that integrates all the OpenStack services. This integration is illustrated in the figure below:

To accomplish these tasks in the most efficient order, this guide organizes the tasks that the network administrator must complete (or verify that are complete) before installing Helion OpenStack, and those tasks that must be accounted for after the Helion OpenStack installation.
