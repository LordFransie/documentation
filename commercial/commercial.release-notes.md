# HP Helion OpenStack&reg; Beta Release Notes

Thanks for your interest in HP Helion OpenStack beta! This release note contains the following information on our software package:

* [Features in HP Helion OpenStack beta](#features) 
* [Recommendations for HP Helion OpenStack beta](#recommendations)
* [For further information](#for-further-information) 

##Features in HP Helion OpenStack beta## {#features}

**OpenStack Icehouse service** - The full set of standard OpenStack services is available for you to use, including Nova, Swift, Cinder, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Horizon, and Heat.

**HP StoreVirtual VSA** - The VSA is used as the default fault-tolerant, software-defined storage backend for Cinder, and provides easy deployment on KVM nodes meeting on-demand scale-out requirements of cloud storage without sacrificing performance.

**Support for VMWare ESXi hypervisor** - Makes ESX host onboarding and management easier and lets you setup the ESX proxy node during installation of the overcloud. 

**HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) application** - Allows you to create networks, subnets and ports, as well as security groups and security group rules for your ESX cluster.

##Recommendations for HP Helion OpenStack beta## {#recommendations}

This section describes the HP recommendations for optimizing performance, utility, and functionality with this software version. We have also provided information about some known issues for reference purposes. This section contains:

* [Best practices recommendations](#best-practices) for optimizing functionality, performance and reliability 
* [Known issues](#known-issues) in this release 

###Recommendations ### {#best-practices} 

HP recommends the following best practices for this software version.

**Installation**

* To ensure a trouble-free installation, we recommend against restarting the system running the installer and seed VM.  If you perform a restart, you may disrupt the baremetal bridge networking configuration and disable the undercloud and overcloud, requiring that you repeat the installation process.
* For the most reliable installation results, use a dedicated system, referred in this documentation as the *installation system* or *KVM host*.  The KVM host running the seed cloud is sometimes reconfigured during the installation process, which may include installing additional software packages and making changes to the network or visualization configuration.

**Note:** The KVM host is a system where Kernel-based Virtual Machine is installed.

* For best performance and resilience, if you are using servers with RAID controllers you must pre-configure them to present their storage as a single logical disk.
* As an aid for future hardware maintenance, we recommend that for your physical servers you track the physical location (slot number and rack) and associated identifiers (such as MAC addresses) for each  server.  The TripleO automation tracks only virtual MAC address and not physical server locations; recording the location information will speed future maintenance efforts on your physical devices.

**Operations**

* We recommend cleaning up any VMs using excess space, by executing the following commands:
    - Delete the KVM VMs and their storage volumes with the `virsh` command.
    - Delete the file `/tmp/seed_options`.
    - Uninstall any packages that you no longer require.

* For optimum VM operation and to avoid generating inaccurate error codes, we recommend you not reboot the overcloud controller but rather restart the applicable services by executing the following commands:
    - sudo service nova-compute restart
    - sudo service nova-scheduler restart
    - sudo service nova-conductor restart
    - sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart

* After deleting a cloud or an entire HP Helion OpenStack Commercial installation, make sure you perform a full disk erasure on the associated storage devices to prevent exposure of sensitive data that may have been stored there. 


###Known issues in this release### {#known-issues}

The following are the known issues for HP Helion OpenStack beta:

**Operations**

* If you determine that your VM seed has not started correctly when you execute the `hp_ced_start_seed` script, run the script a second time to ensure you start the seed.
* If after an overcloud controller reboot you determine the VMs are in an ERROR state, execute the following commands to restart the services and remove the error:
  
		$ sudo service nova-compute restart
		$ sudo service nova-scheduler restart
		$ sudo service nova-conductor restart
		$ sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart

* In some instances, the centralized logging feature does not function after the  product installation. If this occurs, repeat the following steps on the overcloud controller and all compute nodes

        service rsyslog restart
