# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Horizon Service Overview#

Horizon is the OpenStack&#174; service that serves as the basis for the HP Helion OpenStack web interface, or the *dashboards*

The dashboard provides a web-based user interface to HP Helion OpenStack services including [Compute](/helion/openstack/services/compute/overview), [Volume Operations](/helion/openstack/services/volume/overview/), [Networking](/helion/openstack/services/networking/overview), and [Identity](/helion/openstack/services/identity/overview). 

Horizon ships with several dashboards, including a *Project* dashboard, an *Admin* dashboard, and a *System* dashboard. These dashboards provide administrators and users a graphical interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
