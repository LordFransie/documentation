# HP Helion OpenStack&reg; Ironic Service Overview#

HP Helion OpenStack uses the OpenStack&reg; Ironic service during the installation for provisioning of the controller and KVM compute host in a bare metal deployment.

Ironic is an incubated OpenStack project to provision bare metal (as opposed to virtual) machines by leveraging common technologies such as PXE boot and IPMI to cover a wide range of hardware, while supporting pluggable drivers to allow vendor-specific functionality to be added.
