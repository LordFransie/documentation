# End User License Agreement

1. Applicability. This end user license agreement (the "Agreement") governs the use of HP Helion OpenStack&reg; Community ("Software"), unless it is subject to a separate agreement between you and Hewlett-Packard Company and its subsidiaries ("HP"). By downloading, copying, or using the Software, you agree to this Agreement.   

2. Terms. This Agreement includes supporting material accompanying the Software or referenced by HP, which may be software license information, additional license authorizations, software specifications, published warranties, supplier terms, open source software licenses and similar content ("Supporting Material"). 

3. Authorization. If you agree to this Agreement on behalf of another person or entity, you warrant you have authority to do so.

4. Consumer Rights. If you obtained the Software as a consumer, nothing in this Agreement affects your statutory rights.

5. Electronic Delivery. HP may elect to deliver Software, related software product information and Supporting Material by electronic transmission or download.

6. License Grant. If you abide by this Agreement, HP grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use one copy of the version or release of the Software for your internal purposes only, and is subject to any specific software licensing information that is in the Software or its Supporting Material.  To the extent any component of the Software is subject to any third party license terms, including open source license terms, then those third party license terms or open source license terms shall govern with respect to the subject component; otherwise, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, you may not distribute the Software or the components of the Software using HP trademarks unless permitted to do so under a separate written agreement with HP.

    Your use is subject to all of the following restrictions, unless specifically allowed in Supporting Material:

    -  You may not make copies and distribute, resell or sublicense the Software to third parties.
    -  You may not download and use patches, enhancements, bug fixes, or similar updates unless you have a license to the underlying software. However, such license doesn't automatically give you a right to receive such updates and HP reserves the right to make such updates only available to customers with support contracts.
    -  You may not copy the Software or make it available on a public or external distributed network.
    -  You may not allow access on an intranet unless it is restricted to authorized users.
    -  You may make one copy of the Software for archival purposes or when it is an essential step in authorized use.
    -  You may not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt, decompile or make derivative works of the Software except as authorized by statute.  If you make any such modifications, you must inform HP in writing.

7. Ownership. No transfer of ownership of any intellectual property will occur under this Agreement.

8. Copyright Notices. You must reproduce copyright notices on the Software and documentation for authorized copies.

9.  Support.   HP is not required to provide you with technical support.  Any technical support HP does provide to you shall be at HP’s sole discretion and is provided "As Is" except to the extent any additional support is provided in Supporting Material or in a separate support agreement between you and HP.

10. Disclaimer of Warranties.  HP does not warrant that the operation of Software will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that Software will operate in hardware and software combinations other than as authorized by HP in Supporting Material.  THE SOFTWARE AND ALL RELATED COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HP AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO OTHER WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, LEGAL OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY OTHER WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE. 

11. Limitation of Liability.  HP’s liability to you under this Agreement is limited to the amount actually paid by you to HP for the relevant Software.  Neither you nor HP will be liable for lost revenues or profits, downtime costs, loss or unavailability of or damage to data or software restoration, or indirect, special or consequential costs or damages. This provision does not limit either party's liability for: unauthorized use of intellectual property, death or bodily injury caused by their negligence; acts of fraud; willful repudiation of the Agreement; or any liability that may not be excluded or limited by applicable law.

12. Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated or in the case of a limited-term license, upon expiration; however, your rights under this Agreement terminate if you fail to comply with it. Immediately upon termination or expiration, you will destroy the Software and documentation and any copies, or return them to HP. You may keep one copy of Software and documentation for archival purposes. We may ask you to certify in writing you have complied with this section. Warranty disclaimers, the limitation of liability, this section on termination, and Section 13 ("General") will survive termination.

13. General.

    a. Assignment. You may not assign this Agreement without prior written consent of HP and compliance with HP's software license transfer policies. Authorized assignments will terminate your license to the Software and you must deliver Software and documentation and copies thereof to the assignee. The assignee will agree in writing to this Agreement. .

    b. U.S. Government. If the Software is licensed to you for use in the performance of a U.S. Government prime contract or subcontract, you agree that, consistent with FAR 12.211 and 12.212, commercial computer software, computer software documentation and technical data for commercial items are licensed under HP's standard commercial license.

    c. Global Trade Compliance. You agree to comply with the trade-related laws and regulations of the U.S. and other national governments. If you export, import or otherwise transfer products provided under this Agreement, you will be responsible for obtaining any required export or import authorizations. You confirm that you are not located in a country that is subject to trade control sanctions (such as Cuba, Iran, N. Korea, N. Sudan, and Syria) and further agree that you will not retransfer the products to any such country. HP may suspend its performance under this Agreement to the extent required by laws applicable to either party.



    d. Notices. Written notices under this Agreement may be provided to HP via the method provided in the Supporting Material or if none, via "contact HP" site on www.hp.com.

    e. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding rules as to choice and conflict of law. You and HP agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.

    f. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for performance delays nor for non-performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, except for payment obligations.

    g. Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents our entire understanding with respect to its subject matter and supersedes any previous communication or agreements that may exist.  Modifications to the Agreement will be made only through a written amendment signed by both parties. If HP doesn't exercise its rights under this Agreement, such delay is not a waiver of its rights.

14. Australian Consumers. If you acquired the software as a consumer within the meaning of the 'Australian Consumer Law' under the Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) then despite any other provision of this Agreement, the terms at this URL apply: http://www.hp.com/go/SWLicensing.
