####What is HP Helion OpenStack Community? And how does it tie into the overall HP Helion portfolio? #### {#whatcommunity}

The HP Helion OpenStack Community is the first OpenStack distribution from HP. It is a free-to-license and download OpenStack distribution from HP. This will be shipped frequently to stay close to the trunk (once every six weeks). 

It will be the foundational technology for all HP Helion portfolio of products in the future, allowing HP Helion products to quickly leverage the OpenStack capabilities.

####What does this distro enable me to do? #### {#distroenable}

You have consistently given us feedback to release a distribution of OpenStack, fully tested, hardened and supported by HP. And we have listened. 

You can now deploy a cloud-in-a-box with this preview version. 

The final version of this free distribution will enable you to evaluate, deploy small-scale private cloud in production (up to 30 nodes) and develop on OpenStack. You will be able to do this faster and easier with our simplified installer and updater.  

####How does HP Helion OpenStack Community compare to other OpenStack distributions on the market? #### {#howcompare}

HP Helion OpenStack Community is one of the first distributions in the market, based on just released Icehouse release of OpenStack from the community. It is pure OpenStack with no proprietary technology or add-ins from HP. For example, TripleO is used for deployment which is the official OpenStack project for deployment. 
 
####Is there a cost associated with this distribution? #### {#distrocost} 

It is free to download. Optionally, it comes with a support license that you can choose to purchase from HP for access to HP OpenStack technical experts, tools & help with installation. If you're  purchasing support from HP, you'll also be provided with indemnification for potential legal issues if you are deploying this in production. 

####What is TripleO? #### {#TripleO}

OpenStack on OpenStack (or TripleO) is OpenStack's official deployment of OpenStack project. It builds on the core resource-provisioning strengths of OpenStack, to enable cloud administrators to deploy and maintain bare metal installations of OpenStack. Using the same APIs that they are familiar with for deploying workloads on an OpenStack cloud. Template based deployment engine (OpenStack Heat) allows for rigorous testing and reliable, repeatable deployments of known configurations. 
 
####What is available on the preview version announced on May 7th? #### {#preview}

##Installing and Configuring the HP Helion OpenStack Community Edition



###Getting Started 

####What are the prerequisites for installing and configuring the HP Helion OpenStack Community Edition? #### {#prerequisites}

HP Helion OpenStack Community is installed using TripleO, which uses three linked installation phases to deploy a complete OpenStack cloud. 

**Hardware Requirements**

TripleO creates several large VMs as part of the demo deployment process, hence it is essential to use a system that meets the following hardware specification:

* At least 16GB of RAM
* 64 bit Linux machine with at least 16GB of memory to act as the host of the seed VM.
* At least 200GB of available disk space
* Virtualization support, enabled in the BIOS

**Software System Preparation**

1. The following packages must be installed:
$ sudo apt-get install -y libvirt-bin openvswitch-switch openvswitch-common pythonlibvirt
qemu-system-x86 qemu-kvm
2. If you’ve just installed the libvirt packages above, you will need to restart libvirt:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/libvirt-bin restart
3. Ensure that the root user has a public key. Login as root:
$ sudo su -<br>
	Check whether .ssh/id_rsa exists:
	$ ls~root/.ssh/id_rsa
If the key does not exist, create one, omitting a passphrase (just hit return):
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa 

####How do I install the HP Helion OpenStack Community Edition, and what’s included? #### {#HowdoIinstall}

1. Before you begin, remove the item re. creating a VM for the seed. This is done by the installer tool.
2. Login as root and unpack the tar file into root’s home directory:
	$ sudo su -
	$ tar xvf <location-of-.tar.gz-file>

2. This will create and populate a tripleo/ directory within root’s home directory.

3. Ensure that no LC_ variables are set:
$ env | grep ^LC_

4. If any variables are set, unset them using a blank export for each variable:
$ export <LC_VARIABLE_NAME>=

5. Start the seed VM:
$ HP_VM_MODE=y bash -x ~root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_start_seed.sh

The process of starting the seed will take 5-10 minutes, or possibly longer depending on the capabilities of your system. There is currently a substantial amount of script/debug output that will be disabled in the final
customer version.

Allow the process to continue; you may need to ignore a password prompt for a few minutes, then just hit return until the seed setup continues.

Once the seed has completed its setup processing, you can proceed to the second stage, which is to deploy and configure the undercloud and overcloud, and to start a test guest VM in the overcloud compute node.

$ ssh 192.0.2.1 bash -x ~root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh

####What are the minimum and maximum number of configurations allowed? #### {#minimumandmaximumconfigs}

The minimum configuration is seven physical servers:

* One VM for the Seed Cloud
* One Undercloud Server
* Three Overcloud Management Servers
* Two Swift Object Servers
* One compute Server

The maximum supported configuration is 36 servers. 

####How do I install and set up the HP Helion OpenStack Community Edition Admin Node? #### {#installandsetup}

You are recommended to only install the Admin Node on a virtual machine. 
Here are general guidelines for creating a virtual machine in an existing or new hypervisor infrastructure:

1. Configure the hypervisor host's network. The host must provide connectivity to the virtual machine Admin Node on an isolated private network 
to all the bare-metal nodes' port eth0. And the virtual machine Admin Node must also have connectivity to a routable network for Internet access.

2. Create a virtual machine Admin Node with the suggested hardware configuration. The following configuration must be reviewed during this step:

    a. Ensure the virtual machine Admin Node's primary NIC is bridged or connected to the admin network and the second NIC is bridged or connected to a routable network for Internet access.

    b. For the disk configuration, the default Disk bus type/controller uses proprietary technology. Ensure you set that to the IDE/SCSI type.
 
    c. If your hypervisor is KVM, ensure the virt type is set to KVM.
 
3. Download the HP Cloud OS ISO to the host's local file system or data store.

4. Configure the virtual machine Admin Node to point to the ISO as a CD/DVD drive or install media ISO image.

## Setting up the seed cloud 

####What is a seed? #### {#Whatisseed}

The seed machine is a single node that is effectively just an installer.  Its sole purpose is to create the undercloud, and that is all.  This is the equivalent of your workstation, laptop, or maybe staff-shell (if you ever used it).  It uses nova, glance and heat to install the undercloud.

This is not a full OpenStack installation, it is a cut-down installation providing only the software required in order to enable the installation of the undercloud onto physical systems in the data center.

####How do I create a VM for the Seed Cloud based on the CloudOS specifications? #### {#createVM} 

####How do I load a under cloud image into the seed cloud? #### {#imageseedcloud} 

####How do I log into the seed cloud and deploy the undercloud? #### {#deployUC}   

### Setting up the undercloud and overcloud

####What is an undercloud? #### {#Whatisundercloud}

The undercloud is what you use as an administer to maintain the hardware.  It installs physical machines using nova and the baremetal or ironic driver (in the same way that it was installed from the seed). It then uses heat to deploy and configure the resulting booted systems, which is analogous to the use of Chef in HP Public Cloud.  The sole purpose of the undercloud is to administer the physical machines in the data center for the purpose of making them run an OpenStack cloud.

This is not a full OpenStack installation, it is a cut-down installation providing only the software required in order to enable the installation of the overcloud onto physical systems in the data center.

####What is an overcloud? #### {#Whatisovercloud}

This is the HP Public Cloud.  This is the OpenStack installation that you will interact with in the same way you interact with the HP Public Cloud.  This is where the web interface will be housed, and the cloud in which all instances will be created/objects stored/volumes created etc.

This is a full and feature-rich OpenStack installation.

###Understanding how to use the Dashboard UI 

####How do I launch the HP Helion OpenStack Community Dashboard? #### {#launchtheDashboard}

After you boot from the HP Cloud OS ISO, you are ready to launch the Operational Dashboard to set up the Admin Node.

To launch the Operational Dashboard:

1. Get the IP address of your main control plane node via <b><font color="red"><yet to be defined process></font></b>
2. Open a web browser pointing to the IP address.
3. Log in as the ‘admin’ user using the admin password provided via <b><font color="red"><yet to be defined process><
pre-defined login creds: I cannot comment at this point. The admin password MAY be hard-coded into 
images provided, or MAY be randomly generated during install.
Note – don’t refer to “ZIP” files. I doubt we’ll use the zip format.<.font></b>
