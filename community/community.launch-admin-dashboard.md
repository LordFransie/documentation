# Launch the Administration Dashboard

To access the Administration Dashboard:

1. On the Operational Dashboard, select the Cloud tab > Manage Clouds.

2. Select More > Launch for the cloud created.   

When you return to the Administration Dashboard, at http://&lt;public-IP-of-your-cloud-controller>, you will need to login. 

In the current release, the dashboards use pre-defined login credentials. These are not published in the web-hosted documentation. To get the pre-defined login credentials, refer to the readme file included in the same ZIP that contained the HP Cloud OS ISO. 
If you have not already done so, see the ZIP on the <a href="https://cloudos.hpwsportal.com" target="codn">HP Cloud OS Distribution Network</a>. 

## Next Step

For details about the Administration Dashboard, see the [HP Cloud OS Administration Dashboard Help](/cloudos/manage/administration-dashboard/).
