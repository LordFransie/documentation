##Available product versions## {#versions}

This release of the HP Helion OpenStack Community edition contains a single download of the product that covers both virtual and bare metal deployment:

* *A virtual deployment of HP Helion OpenStack Community*. First released in early May, 2014, this provides a "cloud-in-a-box" virtual deployment targeted towards enterprises and cloud administrators interested in evaluating, developing and deploying a private cloud based on OpenStack Cloud Software. It's a pure, free and downloadable OpenStack distribution that speeds up deployment and simplifies the management of small-scale, open cloud environments and infrastructure services. 
* *A bare-metal deployment of HP Helion OpenStack Community*. First released in June, 2014, this edition installs in a physical environment. The baremetal installation allows you to build an OpenStack cloud spanning multiple physical nodes. During installation, this edition sets up an undercloud host and deploys the overcloud on a controller host, 2 physical Swift nodes, and up to 30 physical compute nodes. 

These release notes cover both deployments.


##Features in HP Helion OpenStack Community## {#features}

**Pure OpenStack technology** &mdash; This edition allows you to experience a cloud deployment using [OpenStack TripleO](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO).

**Speeds cloud service delivery** &mdash; Outstanding launch pad for your small-scale open cloud environment or proof-of-concept cloud services, with simple, fast creation of cloud environments and applications to speed business value.

**Close-to-trunk release** &mdash; Allows your lab or small-scale production environment to continue to benefit from the very latest capabilities of OpenStack technology â€“ we closely track the community trunk release.

## Prerequisites 

Note: This section commented out; appears to be a duplicate--and out of date--version of the same information in the install page

This release of the Community edition requires the following:

* [Hardware requirements](#hardwarereqs)
* [System software preparation](#softwareprep)

### Hardware requirements ## {#hardwarereqs}

The [OpenStack TripleO utility](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO) creates several large virtual machines (VMs) as part of the cloud-in-a-box deployment process, so you must use a system that meets or exceeds the following hardware specifications:

* At least 16 GB of RAM
* At least 200 GB of available disk space
* Virtualization support enabled in the BIOS

**Host OS:** Ubuntu 13.10 or 14.04, running on the physical machine
**Supported Guest OS:** Ubuntu 13.10


### Software system preparation ## {softwareprep}

* You must have an Ubuntu 13.10 or 14.04 host operating system installed. Other host operating systems might work but have not been tested. Also, this system does not currently install into a virtual machine.
**Note:** To avoid an install error, where the seed cloud works, but the undercloud and overcloud does not, you must use Ubuntu 13.10 Server **OR** install openssh-server on and Ubuntu 13.10 desktop version and disable all firewalls (ufw). * The host must allow root ssh login.
* The following packages must be installed:
$ sudo apt-get install -y libvirt-bin openvswitch-switch openvswitch-common python-libvirt qemu-system-x86 qemu-kvm
* If you have just installed the libvirt packages, you must reboot or restart libvirt:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/libvirt-bin restart
* Ensure that the root user has a private/public keypair. 1. Login as root:
$ sudo su -
2. Check whether .ssh/id_rsa exists:
      # ls ~root/.ssh/id_rsa
3. If the key does not exist, create one, omitting a passphrase and accepting the defaults by pressing Enter:
      # ssh-keygen -t rsa

##Recommendations for HP Helion OpenStack Community## {#recommendations}

This section describes the HP recommendations for optimizing performance, utility, and functionality with this software version. We have also provided information about some known issues for reference purposes. This section contains:

* [Recommendations for optimizing functionality, performance and reliability](#best-practices) 
* [Known issues in this release](#known-issues) 

###Recommendations ### {#best-practices} 

HP recommends the following best practices for this software version.

**Installation**

* To enable VM functionality, be sure to install the required `qemu-kvm` package.  You can install this package with the command: 

        sudo apt-get install -y qemu-kvm

**Operations**

* When issuing Neutron commands from inside the seed VM, we recommend you set the `LANG` environment variable to `C`.  Add the following line to the appropriate user configuration file:

        export LANG=C
        
* We recommend cleaning up any VMs using excess space, by executing the following commands:
    - Delete the KVM VMs and their storage volumes with the `virsh` command.
    - Delete the file `/tmp/seed_options`.
    - Uninstall any packages that you no longer require.

* For optimum VM operation and to avoid generating inaccurate error codes, we recommend you not reboot the overcloud controller but rather restart the applicable services by executing the following commands:
    - sudo service nova-compute restart
    - sudo service nova-scheduler restart
    - sudo service nova-conductor restart
    - sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart

* After deleting a cloud or an entire HP Helion OpenStack Community installation, make sure you perform a full disk erasure on the associated storage devices to prevent exposure of sensitive data that might have been stored there.

###Known issues in this release### {#known-issues}

The following are the known issues for HP Helion OpenStack Community edition: 

**Operations**

* If you determine that your VM seed has not started correctly when you executed the `hp_ced_start_seed` script, run the script a second time to ensure you start the seed.
* VM installations do not currently persist across reboots.  When you reboot your system, be sure to start a new VM installation.
* If after an overcloud controller reboot you determine the VMs are in an ERROR state, execute the following commands to restart the services and remove the error:
  
		$ sudo service nova-compute restart
		$ sudo service nova-scheduler restart
		$ sudo service nova-conductor restart
		$ sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart
