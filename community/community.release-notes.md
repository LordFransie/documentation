## Prerequisites

Note: This section commented out; appears to be a duplicate--and out of date--version of the same information in the install page

This release of the Community edition requires the following:

* [Hardware requirements](#hardwarereqs)
* [System software preparation](#softwareprep)

### Hardware requirements ## {#hardwarereqs}

The [OpenStack TripleO utility](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO) creates several large virtual machines (VMs) as part of the cloud-in-a-box deployment process, so you must use a system that meets or exceeds the following hardware specifications:

* At least 16 GB of RAM
* At least 200 GB of available disk space
* Virtualization support enabled in the BIOS

**Host OS:** Ubuntu 13.10 or 14.04, running on the physical machine
**Supported Guest OS:** Ubuntu 13.10


### Software system preparation ## {softwareprep}

* You must have an Ubuntu 13.10 or 14.04 host operating system installed. Other host operating systems might work but have not been tested. Also, this system will not currently install into a virtual machine.
**Note:** To avoid an install error, where the seed cloud works, but the undercloud and overcloud will not, you must use Ubuntu 13.10 Server **OR** install openssh-server on and Ubuntu 13.10 desktop version and disable all firewalls (ufw). * The host must allow root ssh login.
* The following packages must be installed:
$ sudo apt-get install -y libvirt-bin openvswitch-switch openvswitch-common python-libvirt qemu-system-x86 qemu-kvm
* If you have just installed the libvirt packages, you must reboot or restart libvirt:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/libvirt-bin restart
* Ensure that the root user has a private/public keypair. 1. Login as root:
$ sudo su -
2. Check whether .ssh/id_rsa exists:
      # ls ~root/.ssh/id_rsa
3. If the key does not exist, create one, omitting a passphrase and accepting the defaults by pressing Enter:
      # ssh-keygen -t rsa

##Recommendations for HP Helion OpenStack Community## {#recommendations}

This section describes the HP recommendations for best performance, utility, and functionality with this software version. We have also provided information about some known issues for reference purposes. This section contains:

* [Recommendations for best functionality, performance and reliability](#best-practices) 
* [Known issues in this release](#known-issues) 

###Recommendations ### {#best-practices} 

HP recommends the following best practices for this software version.

**Installation**

* To enable full VM functionality, be sure to install the required `qemu-kvm` package.  You can install this package with the command: 

        sudo apt-get install -y qemu-kvm

**Operations**

* For best results when issuing Neutron commands from inside the seed VM, we recommend you set the `LANG` environment variable to `C`.  Add the following line to the appropriate user configuration file:

        export LANG=C
        
* For best performance on your system, to clean up any VMs using excess space, execute the following commands:
    - Delete the KVM VMs and their storage volumes with the `virish` command.
    - Delete the file `/tmp/seed_options`.
    - Uninstall any packages that you no longer require.

###Known issues in this release### {#known-issues}

The following are the known issues for HP Helion OpenStack Community edition:

**Operations**

* If you determine that your VM seed has not started correctly when you executed the `hp_ced_start_seed` script, run the script a second time to ensure you start the seed.
* VM installations do not currently persist across reboots.  When you reboot your system, be sure to start a new VM installation.
