# Getting Started with HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Networking Service #

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->

Leveraging OpenStack Networking, HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Networking is a virtual networking service that provides network connectivity and addressing for HP Cloud OS Compute devices.

You can use the default network to deploy Compute virtual servers, or modify the default network to expand networking capabilities.

You can now define and configure your own virtual network topology, including control of IP address ranges.

###Using the dashboards### {#dashboard}

You can use the Administration Dashbord to access HP Cloud OS Focus service. See [Administration Dashboard Tasks by Tab](/cloudos/manage/administration-dashboard/tasks-by-tab/).

###Using the API to access Networking### {#API}
 
You can use a low-level, raw REST API access to HP Cloud OS Networking. See the [HP Cloud OS Networking Service API page](/api/v13/networking).

###Using the CLI### {#cli}

You can use any of several command-line interface software to access HP Cloud OS Networking. See [HP Cloud OS CLI](/cli/).


## For more information ##

For information on how to operate your cloud we suggest you read the [OpenStack Operations Guide](http://docs.openstack.org/ops/) The *Architecture* section contains useful information about how an OpenStack Cloud is put together. However, the HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community edition takes care of these details for you. The *Operations* contains information on how to manage the system.
