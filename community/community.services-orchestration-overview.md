# HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Orchestration Service Overview#

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->

Leveraging OpenStack&reg Heat, the HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Orchestration service implements an orchestration engine to launch multiple composite cloud applications based on templates in the form of text files that can be treated like code. 

### Using the dashboards {#UI}

You can use the [HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Dashboard](/cloudos/community/services/dashboard/overview/) to work with the Orchestration service.

###Using the API to access Compute### {#API}
 
You can use a low-level, raw REST API access to HP Compute. See the [OpenStack Orchestration API v1 Reference](http://api.openstack.org/api-ref-orchestration.html).

###Using the CLI### {#cli}

You can use any of several command-line interface software to access HP Compute. See the [OpenStack Command Line Interface Reference](http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/heatclient_commands.html).


## For more information ##

For information on how to operate your cloud we suggest you read the [OpenStack Operations Guide](http://docs.openstack.org/ops/) The *Architecture* section contains useful information about how an OpenStack Cloud is put together. However, the HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community edition takes care of these details for you. The *Operations* contains information on how to manage the system.
