# Getting Started with HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Graffiti Service #

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md); text from docs.hpcloud.com/cloudos/prepare/overview/ -->

The HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Graffiti service is a pool registry and capability tagging service, that provides a dictionary of the "capabilities" of all the resources in a cloud environment.

The Graffiti service provides the ability to describe requirements and capabilities using a common ontology and to *tag* (or, assign) requirements and capabilities to cloud resources. 

You can then search for cloud resources using on tagged registered requirements and capabilities. 

Graffiti allows users to:

- Publish a common capability ontology
- Publish resources that are described by the Common Capability Ontology
- Select resource pools
- Search the Directory to find resource(s) based on required common capabilities
- Provision a topology binding
- Verify that the provisioning was successful in the cloud

## For more information ##

For information on how to operate your cloud we suggest you read the [OpenStack Operations Guide](http://docs.openstack.org/ops/) The *Architecture* section contains useful information about how an OpenStack Cloud is put together. However, the HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community edition takes care of these details for you. The *Operations* contains information on how to manage the system.
