# Getting Started with HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Cloud OS Volume Service #

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->

Need more storage for your HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community Compute instances? HP Block Storage is the way to go. Based on OpenStack Cinder.

Once created, you can easily disconnect Block Storage volumes from one instance and attach them to another. You can also create Snapshots to easily copy a volume before making significant changes to it. Custom volumes ranging in sizes from 1 GB to 2 TB can be created using a variety of file system types.


###Using the API to access Networking### {#API}
 
You can use a low-level, raw REST API access to HP Cloud OS Volume service. See the [HP Cloud OS Block Storage Service API page](/api/v13/block-storage).

###Using the CLI### {#cli}

You can use any of several command-line interface software to access HP Cloud OS Volume service. See [HP Cloud OS CLI](/cli/).

## For more information ##

For information on how to operate your cloud we suggest you read the [OpenStack Operations Guide](http://docs.openstack.org/ops/) The *Architecture* section contains useful information about how an OpenStack Cloud is put together. However, the HP Helion OpenStack&#174; Community edition takes care of these details for you. The *Operations* contains information on how to manage the system.
