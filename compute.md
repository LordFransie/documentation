HP Cloud Compute Overview

Leveraging OpenStack Compute, HP Cloud compute provides a way to instantiate virtual servers on publicly accessible physical machines hosted in HP data centers. Key terms include:

    Flavor - A unique combination of disk space, memory capacity, and CPU
    Image - A collection of files used as a base installation, typically an operating system such as Ubuntu 10.10 or something similar.
    Server - An instance created out of a Flavor + an Image

A variety of flavors and images are provided by HP Cloud compute that can be used to create a wide mix of servers. The best way to learn more is to start using it yourself over at the Management Console. If you have any questions, try our Forums where you can learn from our own internal experts as well as other users in the HP Public Cloud community.

Note: For security purposes, when you create a server, it is automatically assigned a floating, non-removable IP address.
