# How To's with HP Cloud Networking version 13.5

As you get used to using the compute service, you might need to modify the default network or create additional networks.  This page gives you some how-to's for the following tasks: 
 
* Define and configure your own private virtual networks

* Specify IP addressing for those networks 

* Configure security group parameters that define the firewall rules for virtual servers

* Allocate and manage public floating IP addresses

You can use the the HP Cloud Horizon interface, the HP Cloud CLI, or the HP Cloud Compute Service API to customize a network configuration.  


## Using the Horizon interface ## 

* Create a network

* Manage a network

* Delete a network

* View network, subnet, and router details

See [the MC networking pages](/mc/compute/networks/) for more information about setting up networking using the MC.


## Using the HP Cloud CLI ##

Setup networking parameters from the command line on Unix, MacOS, or Windows.
 
The Unix Command Line Interface is a tool which allows Unix or Mac users to manage HP Cloud from the command line or through automated scripts. You do not need to understand the underlying REST API or XML document format to use the Unix CLI. 

[Click here](https://docs.hpcloud.com/cli/) for more information on using the command line, including:

* Network Commands (version 13.5 and later)
* Subnet Commands (version 13.5 and later)
* Ports Commands (version 13.5 and later)
* Router Commands (version 13.5 and later)
* Security Group Commands
* Security Group Rule Commands
* Addresses or Floating IP Commands
