# HP Cloud Networking Overview #

Leveraging [OpenStack Networking](http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-networking/), HP Cloud Networking is a virtual networking service that provides network connectivity and addressing for HP Cloud compute devices. 

In the 13.5 release, HP Cloud compute and networking services are separate entities, integrating services and providing new features. 

You can use the default network to deploy HP Cloud compute virtual servers, or modify the default network to expand networking capabilities.

You can now define and configure your own virtual network topology, including control of IP address ranges.

###Using the console to access Networking### {#console}

You can use the HP Helion Public Cloud console to access HP Cloud Networking Service. For more information on using the HP Helion Public Cloud console, see [Getting Started with HP Helion Public Cloud Console](/hpcloudconsole).


###Using the API to access Networking### {#API}
 
You can use a low level, raw REST API to access HP Cloud compute. For more information on using the HP Cloud Networking API, see [HP Cloud Networking API Specifications](/api/v13/networking).


###Using language bindings### {#bindings}

You can use any of several language bindings to access HP Cloud compute. For more information on using the HP Cloud Networking API, see [HP Cloud binding support](/bindings/).

###Using the CLI### {#cli}
