./cli.windows.compute.md:For Windows Instances only, if you change your Windows password manually via [RDP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383015(v=vs.85).aspx), you need to manually sync the password with the Windows CLI with the [Reset-Password cmdlet](/cli/windows/reference#reset-password) for the `connect-server` command to work. If you use the `get-password` cmdlet to fetch your original de-crypted Administrator password, and it's available, it will overwrite the password sync.
./cli.windows.containers-and-folders.md:At this point you can issue the `[New-Container](/cli/windows/reference#New-Container)` command and a subsequent issuance of Get-PSDrive lists what you just created (The default drive will not show up the next time you load the shell as it exists only temporarily to bootstrap the Storage Container creation process). Now it's time to take the file system for a spin but before we do that, let's go over a few basic concepts.
./cli.windows.containers-and-folders.md:This system persist its settings in the CLI.config file located in the users application directory. This file is important as it's used for storing Credentials, connection information such as addresses and timeout values, and various other settings. Each time the shell loads, this file is opened and it's settings are used throughout the session. There may be times when you wish to temporarily change these settings to accommodate impersonation, environment change (Pro, QA etc) or other testing scenarios. This can be done in one of two ways:
./cli.windows.installation.md:the install folder specified while in the setup wizard. From there you can register the module with Import-Module .\Climanifest.psd1. Note that this only last for the duration of the Powershell session and it's recommended to add this command to your Profile for best results.

./node.38.md:When working with the HP Helion Public Cloud Identity Services, it's critical to understand the concept of Tenants, Tokens (Scoped and Unscoped), and the REST API.
./publiccloud/apidocs/c1.1/maas-api.md:Since the cpu_total_time for an instance should always be over 0 after it's creation, this should evaluate to true. (Evaluations are done every 60 seconds.) A notification should then be sent out and the alarm will remain in the ALARM state.
./publiccloud/apidocs/c1.1/swift-api.md:A much more common inconsistency you may observe is that after you create, replace or delete an object, the container may not be updated to list the object -- or may have the timestamp of an older object. So when you list the contents of a container, it's possible the list contains objects that were deleted just before you performed the list operation. Similarly, the [X-Account-Object-Count](#x_account_object_count_response) metadata may take some time to update after objects are created or deleted.
./publiccloud/apidocs/c1.1/swift-api.md:* 401 Unauthorized. This can mean that you are not authorized to perform an operation. However, it might also mean that your [authentication token](#using_tokens) has expired. You should attempt to get a new token by contacting the Identity Service (it's also worth retrying failures on the Identity service).
./publiccloud/apidocs/c1.1/swift-api.md:* General Access Control Lists (ACLs). You can apply an ACL as metadata on a container. This allows you to make the container and it's objects world readable or writable. See [General Access Control Lists](#general_acls) for more information.
./publiccloud/apidocs/c1.1/swift-api.md:possible to list it's contents, get, put, modify and delete objects. This is not generally recommended because you may break the versioning semantics of the system with unpredictable results.
./publiccloud/bindings.md:OK, so technically this isn't a binding but it's some open source that we use ourselves that we're making available to the public.  Take a look at our [HPCloud drupal module](http://drupal.org/project/hpcloud), which lets you use Object Storage and CDN to offload files (typically images) from your Drupal site to our services.
./publiccloud/cli.windows.2.compute.md:For Windows Instances only, if you change your Windows password manually via [RDP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383015(v=vs.85).aspx), you need to manually sync the password with the Windows CLI with the [`Reset-Password` cmdlet](http://docs.hpcloud.com/cli/windows/2/reference#reset-password) for the `connect-server` command to work.

./publiccloud/cli.windows.2.installation.md:If you have installed the software through the installer package, registration happens automatically through a supplied Powershell Profile. If the profile was not used, you must move to the install folder specified while in the setup wizard. From there you can register the module with Import-Module .\Climanifest.psd1. Note that this only last for the duration of the Powershell session and it's recommended to add this command to your Profile for best results.

./publiccloud/glossary.md:Sometimes it's a little easy to become lost in the weeds of the cloud nomenclature; for such times, we've created this glossary to help you through.  While this glossary concentrates primarily on terms that are more specific to the HP Helion Public Cloud environment, we have tried to include a salad of general cloud computing terms to help you along.  If you need additional definitions, we suggest going on over to the [Open Stack Glossary](http://cloudglossary.com/) and checking there.

./version-overview.md:Putting all of this together, along with bulk data import capability, means that it's much simpler to move applications to the public cloud and to create applications for the public cloud.
