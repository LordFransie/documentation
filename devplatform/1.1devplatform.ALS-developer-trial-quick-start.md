# HP Helion 1.1 Development Platform: Quick Start Developer Trial {#top}
**Note**: The installation procedure has changed **significantly** from [Helion Development Platform v1.0](/helion/devplatform/ALS-developer-trial-quick-start/). 

The Quick Start Developer Trial is the fastest way to evaluate the HP Helion Development Platform for yourself. Download the files, create and configure your sandbox environment, and deploy one or more sample applications. We provide several sample applications to help you get started quickly, but you may also use your own.
