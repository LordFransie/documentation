# HP Helion 1.1 Development Platform: Resources for Application Developers
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/devplatform/appdev/)

HP has created a series of small, simplified sample applications to help you understand and exercise the Development Platform services.

Each sample builds on the previous one and all source code is provided for you to build, deploy, and take apart. Each sample is provided in multiple languages.
 
##Prerequisites - Before you begin
In order to download and deploy these sample applications, you must have the necessary framework installed and configured.

- HP Helion OpenStack&reg; [cloud deployed](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/overview/)
- Application Lifecycle Service [Cluster](/helion/devplatform/1.1/deploy) available with MySQL and RabbitMQ enabled.
	- You can also quickly setup a cluster in the free and publicly available Helion cloud as part of the [Quick Start Developer Trial](/helion/devplatform/1.1/ALS-developer-trial-quick-start/): 
- Logon and password credentials for the cluster.
- Access to the [Helion command-line interface (CLI)](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/client/)
- (Optional) Access to the [Eclipse](/helion/devplatform/1.1/eclipse/) deployment plugin.

##Sample code {#sample}
For best results, work with each sample in the order in which they are provided, as each one builds on the knowledge provided in the previous sample.
