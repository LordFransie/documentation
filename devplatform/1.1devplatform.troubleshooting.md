#HP Helion 1.1 Development Platform: Installation Troubleshooting


## Service is stuck in download

There are several situations in which a download will not complete.  One cause which is documented, is because the *tmp* directory ran out of space. There is a prerequisite to mount the *tmp* directory to a larger partition.  If you have completed this and it is still failing to download then we will need to reset the download. In the current release, this requires a manual process.

As the "admin" user, in the "admin" tenant, click on **Project**, then **Object Store**. Open the "sherpa-cache" folder and delete the wscatalog.<id> folder which contains the cached download. The service should now be available to download again.


<!----
###Image download terminated

The image download is terminated for some reason and even after retrying to download the image  the status of service remains unchanged, i.e, the status still remains *staged*.


1. Delete the images for that Development Platform service. (Do we need to login to Horizon and delete the image or are there any command executed to delete the image? If any please specify how should a user delete it?)
2.  Delete the heat-templates for the service.
 		
	Perform the following steps:

	1. Login to Horizon as "admin" user.
	2.  Click Object Store  and then select Containers to open the Containers page. 
	3. Delete the heat-templates for the service.

3.  Delete the wscatalog for the service. 
	
	Perform the following steps:

	1.	Login to Horizon as "admin" user.
	2.	Click Project. 
	3.	Click Object Store. Open the "sherpa-cache" folder and delete the wscatalog. folder which contains the cached download. 

The service should now be available to download again.

If  the status still remains unchanged in the Configure Service page then Sherpa is referring to the file cache. To delete the file cache, perform the following:
    	
* Connect to the controller management node  and delete the directory  `/var/cache/sherpa/ws.xxxx`, to reset the state. ( What is the exact file name for ws.xxxx)
   	 
* Delete the contents of the `/var/lib/Sherpa/data` folder. 

* Restart the service apache2 for this change to take effect.
