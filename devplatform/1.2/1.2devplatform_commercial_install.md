# HP Helion 1.2 Development Platform: Commercial Installation and Configuration 

The HP Helion Development Platform (HDP) currently contains four components: Application Lifecycle Service (ALS), Marketplace Service, Messaging Service and Database Service.

The following topics explain how to install and configure the HP Helion Development Platform. There is also [Troubleshooting](/helion/devplatform/1.2/install/troubleshooting/) documentation to handle issues that may occur.

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Downloading, Installing, and Updating the HP Helion Development Platform](#installing-the-hp-helion-development-platform)
* [Installing Services](#installing-services)
* [Installing Services using the UI](#install-services-ui)
* [Install the Messaging Service](#install-messaging)
* [Install the Application Lifecycle Service](#install-als)
* [Install the Database Service](#install-database)
* [Install the Marketplace Service](#install-marketplace)
* [Installing Services using the Command Line](#install-services-commandline)

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The HP Helion Development Platform is installed in the overcloud of HP Helion OpenStack&#174; (HOS). 

Before you begin installation:

- The Cinder block storage service must be configured with either [VSA](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/vsa/overview/) or [3Par](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/3par/).
 
- If you installed HP Helion OpenStack&#174; with **KVM** hypervisor support, configure HP StoreVirtual VSA for Block Storage or configure HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage.

- The system running the installer needs to have Python 2.7. Most modern operating systems include this as part of their base toolkit. This document is geared toward a Linux operating system but this does not preclude the installer from running on other operating systems with some minor modifications to the command-line statements.

- It is strongly recommended to run the HP Helion Development Platform installer (<code>DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh</code>) on the seed node of the HP Helion OpenStack installation. The seed node will already have the requisite key (/root/.ssh/id\_rsa) for access to the overcloud; if the installation is run elsewhere, this key will need to be provided to the installer.

- The installer requires the following packages. If they are not found, it will prompt you to install them.

	* python-dev 
	* libffi-dev 
	* libssl-dev 
	* python-virtualenv
	* python-pip

## Downloading, Installing, and Updating HP Helion Development Platform {#installing-the-hp-helion-development-platform}

### Downloading the Latest Version of HP Helion Development Platform


The installation of the HP Helion Development Platform for HP Helion OpenStack is provided as a small compressed tar file.  The images for the actual services will be downloaded at the installer's request. 

**Note**: Should you need more assistance during installation, the install script also has a help feature.

	./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh -h

1. Register at and download the package from the [HP Helion Development Platform](https://helion.hpwsportal.com/catalog.html#/Home/Show) (HDN). Verify that the package you dowload is 1.2 or later.<span style='color:red'>(TODO: Verify this version number)</span>

1. Before you begin the installation, unpack the tar file. <span style='color:red'>(TODO: Verify this version number)</span>
 
		tar -zxvf DevelopmentPlatform_2.0.0.0.tar.gz

### Installing the HP Helion Development Platform
 
3. Navigate to the *dev-platform-installer* directory inside the dev-platform-installer.

		cd dev-platform-installer  

4. If your network uses a proxy, it may be necessary to set the *https_proxy* shell variable so that the installer may download required Python libraries from the [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) site. To set the *https_proxy* shell variable, enter the following command:

		export https_proxy={ip address or url of http proxy} 
	Example:
		
		export https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com

6. Confirm that you have access to the [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) site. The following commands will verify access to the site and download one of the prerequisite files as a brief test. **Note**: If *ping* is unavailable, use *wget*.

		ping pypi.python.org
		sudo -E pip install python-novaclient

6. If your network uses a proxy, you must define the proxy exclusion list so that proxies are not used for communicating with the services in the overcloud. To define the proxy exclusion list, enter the following command:

		export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,{ip address or host name of identity service aka keystone}  
	Example:
		
		export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.0.0.10 
 
7. Validate Keystone access on port 5000 using *curl*.
	
		curl https://{ip address or host name of identity service aka keystone}:5000
Example:

		curl https://10.0.0.10:5000
<a name="commandline"></a>
8. Run this command to install the Helion Development Platform. You can run this command on any machine that can access the overcloud.<br /> By default the Username is *admin* and the Region is *regionOne*. Use the *admin tenant_id* from the overcloud. The parameter *location/ephemeralca-cacert.crt* can be found on the seed at */usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ephemeralca-cacert.crt*

	In order to update Development Platform UI components on overcloud controllers, the installer will try to connect to them. An ssh key should be specified with *-k /path/to/ssh/key*. If running from the cloud's seed node, this key will already be available to the installer. If running from the seed node, this key can be found in */root/.ssh/id_rsa*. If running from elsewhere, you will need to provide an ssh key that allows overcloud controller access.
 
		sudo ./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh \
			-p {admin_user_password} \
			-u {username} \
			-e {location/ephemeralca-cacert.crt} \
			-k {path/to/ssh/key} \
			install

	If you do NOT have access to the overcloud controllers, you can skip installation of UI updates by passing *-d none* and omitting the *-k* option:

		sudo ./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh \
			-p {admin_user_password} \
            -a {auth_host_ip_address} \
			-u {username} \
            -i {tenant_id} \
			-r {region_name} \
            -e {location/ephemeralca-cacert.crt} -d none \
            install
	
	**Note:** This installer will check to ensure that you are installing on a compatible version of HOS. You will only be allowed to install HDP if you meet a minimum HOS version requirement. It is possible to override this check by passing the –x parameter to the <code>DevelopementPlatform_Setup.sh</code> script, as in the following example:

		sudo ./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh \
			–x \
			-p {admin_user_password} \
			-a {auth_host_ip_address} \
			-u {username} \
			-i {tenant_id} \
			-r {region_name} \
			-e {location/ephemeralca-cacert.crt} \
			install

13. Once the installation is complete, you should see output similar to the following:
 
		2014-06-17 16:53:19.765       INFO Install Complete

## Installing Services {#install-services}

After installing the HP Helion Development Platform, you need to install the services, using either the [UI](#install-services-UI) or the [command line](#install-services-commandline).

##Installing the services using the UI<a name="install-services-ui"></a>  

The following steps describe how to download, install, and configure each of the Helion Development Platform services (Messaging, Application Lifecycle Service [ALS], Database, and Marketplace) using the Horizion interface.

### Application Lifecycle Service (ALS)

### Downloading ALS

1. Open Horizon and log in as an *Admin* user. Then click on the **Admin** panel in Horizon and select **Development Platform**. Finally, click **Configure Services**.

2. Click the **Connect** button on the **Configure Services** screen and enter your username and password for the HP Download Network (HPN). Select the Sign-up button if you do not have an account.

3. In the **Configure Services** panel locate the ALS service in the Configure Services table and select **Download Service** and wait for the download to complete.

### Updating ALS

### Prerequisites

For ALS to install dependencies for deployed applications, you must provide ALS with outbound Internet connectivity. This process is documented in Step 7 of ["Starting the seed and building your cloud"](http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/community/install/#startseed) in the baremetal installation instructions.  If an HTTP Proxy is required for Internet downloads, follow the instructions in the [Administration Guide](/helion/devplatform/1.2/als/admin/server/configuration/#http-proxy).
#### Step 1: Retrieve the Service Update

Use the **Helion Development Platform UI** to check the HP Download Network (HPN) for a new Service Update for the desired service.

**NOTE:** Be sure that the "Admin" project is checked (check mark beside it) from the Project selector before you check for service updates. The Project selector is located at the top of the page to the right of the OpenStack logo.

If there is a new Service Update for the service, retrieve it. This will retrieve the installation package and push it into a container in Swift within your local cloud.

#### Step 2: Install the Service Update

##### Preparation

You will need the following pieces of information in order to run the Messaging Service Update.

<table width=100%>
<tr><th><p>Identifier</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th></tr>
<tr><td><p>BASE_NODE_IP</p></td><td><p>The IP address of the base node for your Helion installation.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>SEED_NODE_IP</p></td><td><p>The IP address of the seed node for your Helion installation.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>USERNAME</p></td><td><p>The username of a cloud admin that has rights to perform an HDP Service Update.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>PASSWORD</p></td><td><p>The password of a cloud admin that has rights to perform an HDP Service Update.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>HEAT_ADMIN_KEY</p></td><td><p>The private key file for the **heat-admin** user. 
Usually available within the root user account on the seed node here: **~/.ssh/id_rsa**</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>CONTAINER_NAME</p></td><td><p>The Swift container that contains the Messaging service update.
 
Defaults to **als-horizon-ui**</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME</p></td><td><p>The filename of the Messaging service update.
 
Typically can be found inside the above container in Swift.</p></td></tr>

</table>

#####Let's get to it!

a) SSH to the seed node of your cloud:

	# SSH to the base node
	ssh USERNAME@BASE_NODE_IP
 
	# Become root
	sudo su (will prompt for the PASSWORD)
 
	# SSH to seed node
	ssh SEED_NODE_IP


b) Ensure your environment has the proper credentials to perform the download from Swift:


	# Source the overcloud credentials to reach Swift 
	export TE_DATAFILE="/root/tripleo/ce_env.json"
	source /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/overcloudrc



c) Use the Swift client to download the Service Update:


	# List the contents of the Swift container for ALS: 
	swift list als-horizon-ui
 
	# Take note of the name of the file within the container
	# ex: SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME.tar.gz
 
	# Download the installation file
	swift download CONTAINER_NAME SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME

d)  Once the file is downloaded, unzip/tar the file:

	tar -zxvf SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME.tar.gz

e) Go into the newly created folder and execute the install script, passing in the location of the private key of the heat-admin account:

	# Source undercloud creds from the same location as the overcloudrc
	source /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/undercloudrc
 
	# Fire up the install!
	cd SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME
	./install.sh HEAT_ADMIN_KEY

#### Step 3: Configure the ALS Service

1. In the Configure Services panel in the **Helion Development Platform UI**, click the **Configure Service** button to configure the ALS service and wait for the configuration step to complete.

2. Log out from the Horizon dashboard. Log back into the Horizon dashboard as a non-admin user and click on the  service's panel under the current Project to begin using the service.

## Install the Messaging Service {#install-messaging}

This section provides details on installing the Messaging service from the Development Platform.

### Connect to the Download Service

1. Open Horizon and login as the "admin" user. Then click on the **Admin** panel in Horizon and select **Development Platform**. Finally, click **Configure Services**.

2. Click the **Connect** button on the **Configure Services** screen and enter your username and password for the HP Download Network (HPN). Select the Sign-up button if you do not have an account.

### Download and Configure the Messaging Service

1. In the **Configure Services** panel locate the **Messaging** item in the Configure Services table and select **Download Service** and wait for the download to complete.

	<img src="media/dev_install_messaging.png"/)>

	**Note:** Downloading multiple services simultaneously is not supported, and will
	leave the server in an error state.

2. Once the download is complete, click the **Configure Service** button to configure the Messaging Service and wait for the configuration step to complete.

3. Log out from the Horizon dashboard. Log back into the Horizon dashboard as a non-admin user and click on the **Messaging** panel under the current Project to begin using the Messaging Service.


## Install the Database Service<a name="install-database"></a>
This section provides details on installing the Database Service from the Development Platform.
This section provides details on installing the Database Service from the Development Platform.

### Prerequisites

#### Availability Zones

To configure the Database Service in a highly available manner, it is necessary to create separate availability zones. As a best practice, HP recommends creating three availability zones. All compute hosts should be placed within one of these availability zones. If a compute host is not associated with an availability zone, the Database Service will not be able to provision a database instance to it. As a result, the Database Service may run out of capacity even though there are compute hosts with free capacity.

The following steps show how to create three availability zones and assign a compute host to the zone.

1. Connect to an overcloud controller node and execute the following commands to create three availability zones named: "AZ-1", "AZ-2" and "AZ-3". 
	
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-1 AZ-1
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-2 AZ-2
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-3 AZ-3
		
2. Validate that the availability zones were correctly created by issuing the following command.
	
		nova aggregate-list
 
3. The following commands will add a compute host to your newly created availability zones. Issue this command for every compute host that you wish to associate with an availability zone.
	
		nova aggregate-add-host <id> <hostname>
 
4. The following command can be used to list all availability zones and the compute hosts associated with them.

		nova availability-zone-list

#### Quotas

The **Database Service** will be installed into the admin tenant of the Helion OpenStack overcloud and the admin tenant must have sufficient quota available and unused resources for the service to use. To check existing quota availability, log-in to Horizon as the **admin** user and open the **Overview** panel under the **Compute** tab.

If you are not configuring the Database Service to be highly available you must have the following quota available:
	
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Resource</th>
  <th align="right">Usage</th>
</tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Floating IPs</td>
  <td align="right">6</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Instances</td>
  <td align="right">6</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Networks</td>
  <td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>RAM (GB)</td>
  <td align="right">24</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Routers</td>
  <td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Security Groups</td>
  <td align="right">6</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Volumes</td>
  <td align="right">4</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Volume Storage (GB)</td>
  <td align="right">160</td>
</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
	
If you have set up Availability Zones and plan to install the Database Service in a highly-available configuration you must have the following quota available:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Resource</th>
  <th align="right">Usage</th>
</tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Floating IPs</td>
  <td align="right">16</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Instances</td>
  <td align="right">16</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Networks</td>
  <td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>RAM (GB)</td>
  <td align="right">64</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Routers</td>
  <td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Security Groups</td>
  <td align="right">6</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Volumes</td>
  <td align="right">4</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Volume Storage (GB)</td>
  <td align="right">160</td>
</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In addition to the quota mentioned above, for every database instance that is created by a user, the necessary resources to create that instance will be deducted from the admin tenant quota. The users database service quota will also be affected.

### Connect to the Download Service

1. Open Horizon and log in as the "admin" user. Then click on the admin panel in Horizon and select the **Development Platform** panel under Admin. Then click on the **Configure Services** sub-panel.

2. Click the **Connect** button on the **Configure Services** panel and enter your username and password for the HP Download Network (HPN). Select the Sign-up button if you do not have an account.

### Download the Database Service

1. In the **Configure Services** panel locate the Database Service item in the Configure Services table and select **Download Service** and wait for the download to complete.

	**Note:** Downloading multiple services simultaneously is not supported, and will
	leave the server in an error state.

2. After all configuration options have been provided, select the **Configure** button to complete the configuration step. Wait for the configuration step to complete and the status to change to **Configured**.

----------

The following steps will configure HAProxy to receive and forward HTTP requests to the VM that hosts the REST API endpoint for the Database Service.<br /> **Note**: To perform these steps you must be connected to the overcloud.
	
1. Identify the API server IPs on the SVC network. You should have as many API servers (and IPs) as you have Availability Zones in your Helion OpenStack installation.

		nova list | awk '/trove[0-9]*_api/{ print $4,"\t", substr($12,5) }' 

2. Identify the Virtual IP used by the controller nodes to be able to load balance the Helion OpenStack services:
			
		keystone endpoint-list | awk '/8779/{ print $6 }' | egrep -o "[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+"

3. Update configuration on each of the Helion OpenStack controller nodes by connecting to the controller and doing the following:

	a. Edit the */etc/haproxy/manual/paas.cfg* file and add the following lines. The last line should be repeated once for each API server identified in step 1. 
	
		listen trove_api
		bind <Virtual IP from step 2>:8779
		option httpchk GET /
		server trove-trove<n>_api-<uniqueid> <API server n's IP Address> check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5 check-ssl ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

	b. Edit the /etc/iptables/rules.v4 file and add to it:

		-I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8779 -j ACCEPT

	c. Run the following command as root:

		sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8779 -j ACCEPT
				
	d. Reload the haproxy service configuration
		
		sudo service haproxy reload

3. Log out from the Horizon dashboard. Log back into the Horizon dashboard as a non-admin user and click on the **Database** panel under the current Project to being using Database Service.

## Install the Marketplace Service<a name="install-marketplace"></a>
This section provides details on installing the Marketplace service from the Development Platform.

### Prerequisites

	**Note:** Downloading multiple services simultaneously is not supported, and will
	leave the server in an error state.
 
4. Log back into the Horizon console as a non-admin user. Click on the **Marketplace** panel under the current Project to begin using the Marketplace Service. You may now install [Marketplace packages](/helion/devplatform/1.1/marketplace/#install).


Your installation is now complete. If you encounter problems, refer to the [Troubleshooting](/helion/devplatform/1.1/install/troubleshooting/) documentation.

##Installing services using the command line <a name="install-services-commandline"></a>

###Configuration

####CA Certificate

In order for the installer to work, you will need the CA certificate for the overcloud. This is located on any of the seed, undercloud, or overcloud nodes at <code>/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ephemeralca-cacert.crt</code>. Copy the contents of this file to a local file in the <code>dev-platform-installer</code> directory. You will specify this file both in the config file below and in the command line options.  

When you install the HP Helion Development Platform by using the <code>DevelopmentPlatform.sh</code> command, it will create a basic configuration file with the values that you specified in the command line.  Here is an example:

	[DEFAULT]
	region=regionOne
	username=admin
	password=<password>
	tenant_name=admin
	tenant_id=1edf76ddfd544529aea69a3874472706
	auth_url=https://10.23.71.14:5000/v2.0
	codn_username=admin.name@hp.com
	codn_password=<codn password>
	ca_cert=/root/ephemeralca-cacert.crt

You can modify the configuration file to add a section for each service, and install each service by using the command line installation utility.

#### Database Installation 

To install the Database Service from the command line, you will need to add a database section to the configuration file.  The following snippet shows most of the settings that can be used in the configuration file, and where to find each setting:

	[DEFAULT]
	region={region name used in installation. Default is 'regionOne'.}
	username={nova user to authenticate as. The usual setting is 'admin'.]
	password={password for the nova user. If 'admin' is used for the username, the password is stored in /root/tripleo/tripleo-overcloud-passwords on the seed VM, or in the overcloud stackrc file.}
	tenant_name={the tenant name associated with the username above.}
	tenant_id={tenant id for tenant. To find this, use: keystone tenant-list | grep admin | awk '{print $2}'}
	auth_url={The nova authentication url. This can be found in the overcloud stackrc or from the output of the HOS install, found in /var/log/.}
	codn_username={Content Delivery Network username for an account with access to the enterprise downloads.  You can create an account at https://helion.hpwsportal.com/catalog.html#/Home/Show.}
	codn_password={password for the CODN account above.}
	ca_cert={path to local copy of the ephemeral CA certificate.  This can be found on the seed VM at /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ephemeralca-cacert.crt}
	debug={set to true to enable debug output}
	[database]
	external_network={The name of the external network. This can be found by executing: ext-net uuid. neutron net-list | grep ext-net | awk '{print $2}'}
	provider_network={The SVC network uuid. This can be found by executing:neutron net-list | grep SVC | awk '{print $2}'}
	#File_url is not currently supported, use file_path instead
	#file_url=http://tarballs.cloud.gozer.hpcloud.net/dbaas-csu/dbaas_latest.csu
	file_path={The path to local dbaas_*.csu file}
	ntp_server={The address for a time server.  Under HOS,  DNS is currently not working, so an IP address is needed}
	keypair={keypair in nova/horizon that you have the private key for}
	# enable_ha=False
	flavor={Global flavor type. 'm1.small' is sufficient.}
	database_flavor={Database flavor type. This must be 'm1.large' or larger for mysql to have enough RAM to start}
	messaging_flavor={Messaging flavor type 'm1.small' is sufficient.}
	database_volume_size=5
	ephemeral_ca_host={The IP address for the ephemeral CA certificate host.  In HOS this will be the same as the IP address used in the auth_url setting.}
	ephemeral_ca_password={The ephemeral CA password, found in /root/tripleo/tripleo-overcloud-passwords on the seed VM.}
	ephemeral_ca_cert={The path to the local copy of the ephemeral CA certificate.  This can be found on the seed VM at /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ephemeralca-cacert.crt}
	ephemeralca_scheme={This defaults to 'http'.  If you are using HOS, you must set this option to 'https'.}
	logstash_rabbitmq_host={The IP address for the RabbitMQ cluster endpoint.  In HOS, this will be the same as the IP address used in the auth_url setting.}
	logstash_rabbitmq_password={The RabbitMQ password, found in /root/tripleo/tripleo-overcloud-passwords on the seed VM.}
	disable_rollback={Set to 'true' to not have instances deleted on failure (for troubleshooting purposes.)}

Once the configuration file is updated with these settings, you can install the database with either of the following methods:

* Run the <code>DevelopmentPlatform.sh</code> script:

<pre>
DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh -u <nova username> -p <nova user password> -a <nova auth url> -t <tenant name> -i <tenant uuid> -c <codn username> -o <codn password> -e <path to local CA cert> install-database
</pre>
	 
* Run the Activate script to prepare the environment, and run the devplatform-installer binary directly:

<pre>
source .env/bin/activate
devplatform-installer --config-file /root/dev-platform-installer/dev-platform-installer.conf install-database
</pre>

If everything goes well, you should have a stack up and running in around 30 minutes

#### Installing and uninstalling services, and querying service status

To install or uninstall services, or to query service status, use the following command:

	./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh -a {ip address for overcloud keystone} -p {password for admin} -i {id for admin tenant} -c {codn username} -o {codn password} -e {cloud ephemeral ca cert path} {serviceoption}

Options for {serviceoption} include:

* status-{service}
* install-{service}
* uninstall-{service}

where {service} is one of the following:

* als
* database
* marketplace
* messaging

For instance, to query the status of the ALS service, use the following:

	./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh -a {ip address for overcloud keystone} -p {password for admin} -i {id for admin tenant} -c {codn username} -o {codn password} -e {cloud ephemeral ca cert path} status-als\
