# HP Helion 1.2 Development Platform: Commercial Installation and Configuration 
[See the Helion 1.0 Development Platform version of this page](/helion/devplatform/install/)

The HP Helion Development Platform currently contains four products: Application Lifecycle Service (ALS), Marketplace Service, Cue Service and Database Service.

The following topics explain how to install and configure the HP Helion Development Platform. There is also [Troubleshooting](/helion/devplatform/1.2/install/troubleshooting/) documentation to handle issues that may occur.

**NOTE**: If you are installing the HP Helion Development Platform **Community** edition, follow the [HP Helion Development Community Installation and Configuration](/helion/devplatform/1.2/install/community/) instructions instead.

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Installing the HP Helion Development Platform](#installing-the-hp-helion-development-platform)
* [Install the Cue Service](#install-cue)
* [Install the Application Lifecycle Service](#install-als)
* [Install the Database Service](#install-database)
* [Install the Marketplace Service](#install-marketplace)

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The HP Helion Development Platform is installed in the overcloud of HP Helion OpenStack&#174;. 

Before you begin installation:

- The Cinder block storage service must be configured with either [VSA](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/vsa/overview/) or [3Par](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/3par/).
 
- If you installed HP Helion OpenStack&#174; with **KVM** hypervisor support, configure HP StoreVirtual VSA for Block Storage or configure HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage.

- If you installed HP Helion OpenStack with **ESX** hypervisor support, deploy the compute proxy on the ESX hosts and deploy OVSvApp for HP Virtual Cloud Networking. Note that the HP Helion Development Platform expects the cloud management service to communicate with both service **and** external networks.

- The system running the installer needs to have Python 2.7. Most modern operating systems include this as part of their base toolkit. This document is geared toward a Linux operating system but this does not preclude the installer from running on other operating systems with some minor modifications to the command-line statements.

- The installer requires the following packages. If they are not found, it will prompt you to install them.

	* python-dev 
	* libffi-dev 
	* libssl-dev 
	* python-virtualenv
	* python-pip

    
## Installing the HP Helion Development Platform {#installing-the-hp-helion-development-platform}

### Downloading and unpacking the installation file

The installation of the HP Helion Development Platform for the HP Helion OpenStack Commercial Edition is provided as a small compressed tar file.  The images for the actual services will be downloaded at the installer's request.

**Note**: Should you need more assistance during installation, the install script also has a help feature.

	./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh -h

1. Register at and download the package from the [HP Helion Development Platform](https://helion.hpwsportal.com/catalog.html#/Home/Show) (HDN). 

1. Before you begin the installation, unpack the tar file.
 
		tar -zxvf DevelopmentPlatform_1.1.0.7.tar.gz
 
3. Navigate to the *dev-platform-installer* directory inside the dev-platform-installer.

		cd dev-platform-installer  

4. If your network uses a proxy, it may be necessary to set the *https_proxy* shell variable so that the installer may download required Python libraries from the [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) site. To set the *https_proxy* shell variable, enter the following command:

		export https_proxy={ip address or url of http proxy} 
	Example:
		
		export https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com

6. Confirm that you have access to the [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) site. The following commands will verify access to the site and download one of the prerequisite files as a brief test.

		ping pypi.python.org
		sudo -E pip install python-novaclient

6. If your network uses a proxy, you must define the proxy exclusion list so that proxies are not used for communicating with the services in the overcloud. To define the proxy exclusion list, enter the following command:

		export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,{ip address or host name of identity service aka keystone}  
	Example:
		
		export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.0.0.10 
 
7. Validate Keystone access on port 5000 using *curl*.
	
		curl https://{ip address or host name of identity service aka keystone}:5000
Example:

		curl https://10.0.0.10:5000
<a name="commandline"></a>
8. Run this command to install the Helion Development Platform.<br /> By default the Username is *admin* and the Region is *regionOne*. 
 
		sudo ./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh -p {admin_user_password} -a {auth_host_ip_address} -u {username} -i {tenant_id} -r {region_name} -e {location/ephemeralca-cacert.crt} install

13. Once the installation is complete, you should see output similar to the following:
 
		2014-06-17 16:53:19.765       INFO Install Complete

## Install the DBaaS/Trove Service<a name="install-database"></a>
This section provides details on installing the DBaaS/Trove Service from the Development Platform.

### Prerequisites

#### Availability Zones

To configure the DBaaS/Trove Service in a highly available manner, it is necessary to create separate availability zones. As a best practice, HP recommends creating three availability zones. All compute hosts should be placed within one of these availability zones. If a compute host is not associated with an availability zone, the DBaaS/Trove Service will not be able to provision a database instance to it. As a result, the DBaaS/Trove Service may run out of capacity even though there are compute hosts with free capacity.

The following steps show how to create three availability zones and assign a compute host to the zone.

1. Connect to an overcloud controller node and execute the following commands to create three availability zones named: "AZ-1", "AZ-2" and "AZ-3". 
	
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-1 AZ-1
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-2 AZ-2
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-3 AZ-3
		
2. Validate that the availability zones were correctly created by issuing the following command.
	
		nova aggregate-list
 
3. The following commands will add a compute host to your newly created availability zones. Issue this command for every compute host that you wish to associate with an availability zone.
	
		nova aggregate-add-host <id> <hostname>
 
4. The following command can be used to list all availability zones and the compute hosts associated with them.

		nova availability-zone-list

#### Quotas

The **DBaaS/Trove Service** will be installed into the admin tenant of the Helion OpenStack overcloud and the admin tenant must have sufficient quota available and unused resources for the service to use. To check existing quota availability, log-in to Horizon as the **admin** user and open the **Overview** panel under the **Compute** tab.

If you are not configuring the DBaaS/Trove Service to be highly available you must have the following quota available:
	
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Resource</th>
  <th align="right">Usage</th>
</tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Floating IPs</td>
  <td align="right">6</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Instances</td>
  <td align="right">6</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Networks</td>
  <td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>RAM (GB)</td>
  <td align="right">24</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Routers</td>
  <td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Security Groups</td>
  <td align="right">6</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Volumes</td>
  <td align="right">4</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Volume Storage (GB)</td>
  <td align="right">160</td>
</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

	
If you have set up Availability Zones and plan to install the DBaaS/Trove Service in a highly-available configuration you must have the following quota available:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Resource</th>
  <th align="right">Usage</th>
</tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Floating IPs</td>
  <td align="right">16</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Instances</td>
  <td align="right">16</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Networks</td>
  <td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>RAM (GB)</td>
  <td align="right">64</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Routers</td>
  <td align="right">2</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Security Groups</td>
  <td align="right">6</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Volumes</td>
  <td align="right">4</td>
</tr>
    <tr><td>Volume Storage (GB)</td>
  <td align="right">160</td>
</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In addition to the quota mentioned above, for every database instance that is created by a user, the necessary resources to create that instance will be deducted from the admin tenant quota. The user's database service quota will also be affected.

### Download the DBaaS/Trove Service

1. Open Horizon and login as the "admin" user. Then click on the admin panel in Horizon and select the **Development Platform** panel under Admin. Then click on the **Configure Services** sub-panel.

2. Click the **Connect** button on the **Configure Services** panel and enter your username and password for the HP Download Network (HPN). Select the Sign-up button if you do not have an account.

3. In the **Configure Services** panel locate the DBaaS/Trove Service item in the Configure Services table and select **Download Service** and wait for the download to complete.

2. After all configuration options have been provided, select the **Configure** button to complete the configuration step. Wait for the configuration step to complete and the status to change to **Configured**.

----------

The following steps will configure HAProxy to receive and forward HTTP requests to the VM that hosts the REST API endpoint for Marketplace. To perform these steps you must be connected to the overcloud node.
	
1. Identify the API server IPs on the SVC network. You should have as many API servers (and IPs) as you have Availability Zones in your Helion OpenStack install.

		nova list | awk '/trove[0-9]*_api/{ print $4,"\t", substr($12,5) }' 

2. Identify the Virtual IP used by the controller nodes to be able to load balance the Helion 	OpenStack services:
			
		keystone endpoint-list | awk '/8779/{ print $6 }' | egrep -o "[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+"

3. Update configuration on each of the Helion OpenStack controller nodes by connecting to the controller and doing the following:

	a. Edit the */etc/haproxy/manual/paas.cfg* file and add the following lines. The last line should be repeated once for each API server identified in step 1. 
	
		listen trove_api
		bind <Virtual IP from step 2>:8779
		option httpchk GET /
		server trove-trove<n>_api-<uniqueid> <API server n's IP Address> check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5 check-ssl ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

	b. Edit the /etc/iptables/rules.v4 file and add to the end of it:

		-I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8779 -j ACCEPT

	c. Run the following command as root:

		sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8779 -j ACCEPT
				
	d. Reload the haproxy service configuration
		
		sudo service haproxy reload

3. Log out from the Horizon dashboard. Log back into the Horizon dashboard as a non-admin user and click on the **Database** panel under the current Project to being using Database Service.

#####Let's get to it!

a) SSH to the seed node of your cloud:

	# SSH to the base node
	ssh USERNAME@BASE_NODE_IP
 
	# Become root
	sudo su (will prompt for the PASSWORD)
 
	# SSH to seed node
	ssh SEED_NODE_IP


b) Ensure your environment has the proper credentials to perform the download from Swift:


	# Source the overcloud credentials to reach Swift 
	export TE_DATAFILE="/root/tripleo/ce_env.json"
	source /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/overcloudrc



c) Use the Swift client to download the Service Update:


	# List the contents of the Swift container
	swift list murano-dashboard-horizon-ui
 
	# Take note of the name of the file within the container
	# ex: SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME.tar.gz
 
	# Download the installation file
	swift download CONTAINER_NAME SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME



d)  Once the file is downloaded, unzip/tar the file:

	tar -zxvf SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME.tar.gz

e) Go into the newly created folder and execute the install script, passing in the location of the private key of the **heat-admin** account:

	# Source undercloud creds from the same location as the overcloudrc
	source /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/undercloudrc
 
	# Fire up the install!
	cd SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME
	./install.sh HEAT_ADMIN_KEY

#### Step 3: Configure the Marketplace Service

1. In the **Helion Development Platform UI** , click the **Configure Service** button to begin configuration of the service. In the configuration dialog, specify the following configuration options:

	- **Service User Password** (Required) -  The password for the Admin user that is currently logged in. This password MUST match the password used to log in to Horizon.
	- **Key Pair** (Required) -  Key Pair to install on all instances created as part of the database service. The public key can be used by an admin to get SSH access to all instances.
	- **External Network** (Required) - Network Name for the network that has external network access. For HP Helion OpenStack Commercial Edition this network is named 'ext-net'
	- **Provider Network** (Required) - Network Name for the network that has network access to cloud infrastructure services. For HP Helion OpenStack Commercial Edition this network is named 'SVC'
	- **NTP Server IP** - IP Address to an NTP server to use if instances will not have outbound access to the internet.
	- **Logstash RabbitMQ IP Address** (Required) - Specify the IP address of the RabbitMQ Server publishing to the central Logstash server.
	- **Logstash RabbitMQ Password** (Required) -  Specify the password for the RabbitMQ Server publishing to the central Logstash server.
	- **Ephemeral CA Password** (Required) - Specify the password for the Ephemeral CA server.
	- **Ephemeral CA IP Address** (Required) - Specify the IP address of Ephemeral CA server.
	- **Subnet range** (Required) - The subnet to use for Marketplace. <br /><br />

2. Do not attempt to install any Marketplace packages yet. Log out from the Horizon console.

3. The following steps will configure HAProxy to receive and forward HTTP requests to the VM that hosts the REST API endpoint for Marketplace. To perform these steps you must be connected to the overcloud node.
	1. Identify the API server IPs on the SVC network:
		 
			nova list | awk'/marketplace-api/{ print $14 }' | cut -d "=" -f 2
					
		
		Note that you should have as many API servers (and IPs) as you have Availability Zones in your Helion OpenStack install.
	1. Identify the Virtual IP used by the controller nodes to be able to load balance the Helion OpenStack services:
	 
			keystone endpoint-list | awk '/8082/{ print $6}' | egrep -o "[0-9].[0-9].[0-9].[0-9]"

	1. Update configuration on each of the Helion OpenStack controller nodes. <br /> For EACH node:
		1. Connect to the controller.
		2. Open the */etc/haproxy/manual/paas.cfg* file and add the following lines. <br /> **Note**: The last line should be repeated once for **each** API server identified in step 1.
		 
				listen marketplace_api
				bind <Virtual IP from step 2>:8082
				option httpchk GET /
				server marketplace<n>_api-<uniqueid> <API server n's IP Address> check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5 check-ssl ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 

		3. Open the */etc/iptables/iptables* file and add to the end of it:
		 
				-I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8082 -j ACCEPT

		4.  Run the following command as root:
		  
				sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8082 -j ACCEPT

		5.  Reload the haproxy service configuration.
		  
				sudo service haproxy reload

4. Log back into the Horizon console as a non-admin user. Click on the **Marketplace** panel under the current Project to begin using the Marketplace Service. You may now install [Marketplace packages](/helion/devplatform/1.2/marketplace/#install).

Your installation is now complete. If you encounter problems, refer to the [Troubleshooting](/helion/devplatform/1.2/install/troubleshooting/) documentation.
