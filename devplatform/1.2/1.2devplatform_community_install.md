# HP Helion 1.2 Development Platform: Community Installation and Configuration
[See the Helion 1.0 Development Platform version of this page](/helion/devplatform/install/community/)

The HP Helion Development Platform currently contains four products: [Application Lifecycle Service (ALS), Marketplace Service, Messaging Service and Database Service](/helion/devplatform/1.2/).

**NOTE**: If you are installing the HP Helion Development Platform **Commercial** edition, follow the [HP Helion Development Commercial Installation and Configuration](/helion/devplatform/1.2/install/) instructions instead.

The following topics explain how to install and configure the HP Helion Development Platform.

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Installing the HP Helion Development Platform](#installing-the-hp-helion-development-platform)
* [Install the Messaging Service](#messaging-install)
* [Install the Application Lifecycle Service](#als-install)
* [Install the Database Service](#database-install)
* [Install the Marketplace Service](#marketplace-install)
* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The HP Helion Development Platform is installed in the overcloud of HP Helion OpenStack&#174;.

- If you installed HP Helion OpenStack with KVM hypervisor support, you should configure HP StoreVirtual VSA for Block Storage or configure HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage.

- If you installed with ESX hypervisor support, then deploy the compute proxy on the ESX hosts and deploy OVSvApp for HP Virtual Cloud Networking.


The system running the installer needs to have Python 2.7. Most modern operating systems include this as part of their base toolkit. This document is geared toward a Linux operating system but this does not preclude the installer from running on other operating systems with some minor modifications to the command-line statements used in this document.
 
The installer requires the following packages. If they are not found, it will prompt you to install them.

* python-dev 
* libffi-dev 
* libssl-dev 
* python-virtualenv
* python-pip

Use the following command:

	sudo apt-get install -y python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev python-virtualenv python-pip

2. After all configuration options have been provided, select the **Configure** button to complete the configuration step. Wait for the configuration step to complete and the status to change to **Configured**.

----------

The following steps will configure HAProxy to receive and forward HTTP requests to the VM that hosts the REST API endpoint for Marketplace. To perform these steps you must be connected to the overcloud node.
	
1. Identify the API server IPs on the SVC network. You should have as many API servers (and IPs) as you have Availability Zones in your Helion OpenStack install.

		nova list | awk '/trove[0-9]*_api/{ print $4,"\t", substr($12,5) }' 

2. Identify the Virtual IP used by the controller nodes to be able to load balance the Helion 	OpenStack services:
			
		keystone endpoint-list | awk '/8779/{ print $6 }' | egrep -o "[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+"

3. Update configuration on each of the Helion OpenStack controller nodes by connecting to the controller and doing the following:

	a. Edit the */etc/haproxy/manual/paas.cfg* file and add the following lines. The last line should be repeated once for each API server identified in step 1. 
	
		listen trove_api
		bind <Virtual IP from step 2>:8779
		option httpchk GET /
		server trove-trove<n>_api-<uniqueid> <API server n's IP Address> check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5 check-ssl ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

	b. Edit the /etc/iptables/rules.v4 file and add to it:

		-I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8779 -j ACCEPT

	c. Run the following command as root:

		sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8779 -j ACCEPT
				
	d. Reload the haproxy service configuration
		
		sudo service haproxy reload

3. Log out from the Horizon dashboard. Log back into the Horizon dashboard as a non-admin user and click on the **Database Service** panel under the current Project to being using Database Service.

	- **Service User Password** (Required) -  The password for the Admin user that is currently logged in. This password MUST match the password used to log in to Horizon.
	- **Key Pair** (Required) -  Key Pair to install on all instances created as part of the database service. The public key can be used by an admin to get SSH access to all instances.
	- **External Network** (Required) - Network Name for the network that has external network access. For HP Helion OpenStack Commercial Edition this network is named 'ext-net'
	- **Provider Network** (Required) - Network Name for the network that has network access to cloud infrastructure services. For HP Helion OpenStack Commercial Edition this network is named 'SVC'
	- **NTP Server IP** - IP Address to an NTP server to use if instances will not have outbound access to the internet.
	- **Logstash RabbitMQ IP Address** (Required) - Specify the IP address of the RabbitMQ Server publishing to the central Logstash server.
	- **Logstash RabbitMQ Password** (Required) -  Specify the password for the RabbitMQ Server publishing to the central Logstash server.
	- **Ephemeral CA Password** (Required) - Specify the password for the Ephemeral CA server.
	- **Ephemeral CA IP Address** (Required) - Specify the IP address of Ephemeral CA server.
	- **Subnet range** (Required) - The subnet to use for Marketplace. <br /><br />

2. Do not attempt to install any Marketplace packages yet. Log out from the Horizon console.

3. The following steps will configure HAProxy to receive and forward HTTP requests to the VM that hosts the REST API endpoint for Marketplace. To perform these steps you must be connected to the overcloud node.
	1. Identify the API server IPs on the SVC network:
		 
			nova list | awk'/marketplace-api/{ print $14 }' | cut -d "=" -f 2
					
		
		Note that you should have as many API servers (and IPs) as you have Availability Zones in your Helion OpenStack install.
	1. Identify the Virtual IP used by the controller nodes to be able to load balance the Helion OpenStack services:
	 
			keystone endpoint-list | awk '/8082/{ print $6}' | egrep -o "[0-9].[0-9].[0-9].[0-9]"

	1. Update configuration on each of the Helion OpenStack controller nodes. <br /> For EACH node:
		1. Connect to the controller.
		2. Open the */etc/haproxy/manual/paas.cfg* file and add the following lines. <br /> **Note**: The last line should be repeated once for **each** API server identified in step 1.
		 
				listen marketplace_api
				bind <Virtual IP from step 2>:8082
				option httpchk GET /
				server marketplace<n>_api-<uniqueid> <API server n's IP Address> check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5 check-ssl ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 

		3. Edit the */etc/iptables/iptables* file and add to the file:
		 
				-I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8082 -j ACCEPT

		4.  Run the following command as root:
		  
				sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 8082 -j ACCEPT

		5.  Reload the haproxy service configuration.
		  
				sudo service haproxy reload

4. Download the Vertica package.
 
	a) Open Horizon and log in as the "admin" user. Then click on the admin panel in Horizon and select the Development Platform Panel under Admin. Then click on the Configure Services sub-panel.

	b) Select the "Vertica Trial Package for Marketplace".

	d) Wait for the service to finish downloading.

4. Log back into the Horizon console as a non-admin user. Click on the **Marketplace** panel under the current Project to begin using the Marketplace Service. You may now install [Marketplace packages](/helion/devplatform/1.2/marketplace/#install).

Refer to the following topics if you experience problems with the installation.


### Service is stuck in download {#troubleshooting-service}

There are situations in which a download will not complete.  One cause which is documented, is because the `tmp` directory ran out of space. There is a prerequisite to mount the `tmp` directory to a larger partition.  If you have completed this step and the download is still failing, then we will need to reset the download. In the current release, this requires a manual process.

As the *admin* user, in the Admin project, click on **Project**, then **Object Store**. Open the `sherpa-cache` folder and delete the `wscatalog.<id>` folder which contains the cached download. The service should now be available to download again.
