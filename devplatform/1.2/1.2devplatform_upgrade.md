# HP Helion 1.2 Development Platform: Upgrading from HP Helion Development Platform 1.1

If Helion Development Platform 1.1 is installed on Helion OpenStack 1.1, and the Helion OpenStack environment is updated to version 1.1.1, the Helion Developer Platform services must be stopped, and the control plane VMs must be restarted to complete the upgrade.

If Helion OpenStack version 1.1 is upgraded to version 1.1.1 without Helion Development Platform installed, no upgrade is necessary, and Helion Development Platform 1.2 can be installed normally. See <a href="/helion/devplatform/1.2/install/">HP Helion 1.2 Development Platform: Installation and Configuration</a> for instructions for a new installation.

When Helion OpenStack is updated from 1.1. to 1.1.1, the Marketplace, Messaging, and Database services will automatically be updated to version 1.2. To update the Application Lifecycle Service, version 1.2 of the service must be downloaded and installed.

### Stopping Helion Development Platform services<a name="HDPstop"></a> 
 
Before stopping services, check that the service control plane is in healthy state (this is required for trove and marketplace). 

To run the Helion Devleopment Platform scripts, perform the following steps:

1. Set `dev_plat_service` to the name of the service (trove/marketplace).
2. Set `skip_ha_checks` if the service control plane is not running in HA mode. 
3. Provide path to the SSH private key that can be used to connect to the service control plane VMs.
4. Back up the ansible folder and move the latest build to its location:
		
		mv /opt/stack/tripleo-ansible /opt/stack/tripleo-ansible-old
		mv /opt/stack/tripleo-ansible-build-81 /opt/stack/tripleo-ansible

4. Source credentials for the Nova account which was used to set up the Helion Developer Platform service by entering:
	
		cd /opt/stack/tripleo-ansible 
		source overcloud.stackrc
		source /opt/stack/venvs/openstack/bin/activate
		ansible-playbook \
			--extra-vars dev_plat_service=<service> \
			--private-key <path to SSH private key> \
			--skip_ha_checks=True \
			-u heat-admin \
			-i plugins/inventory/dev_platform_heat.py \
			playbooks/dev-platform/dev_platform_pre_check.yml 
   


5. If service is in healthy state, stop it by entering (if the service is not in a healthy state, contact customer support): 
  
		ansible-playbook \
			--extra-vars dev_plat_service=<service> \
			--private-key <path to SSH private key> \
			-u heat-admin \
			-i plugins/inventory/dev_platform_heat.py \
			playbooks/dev-platform/dev_platform_stop.yml
 
6. Stop the control plane VMs by entering:

		scripts/dev-platform/stop_dev_platform_instances.bash 
   
You can now run the update script.

### Restarting Helion Development Platform control plane VMs<a name="HDPstart"></a> 


After running update on the overcloud, the VMs running on the Compute hosts are in a shutdown state, so you need to first start the Helion Development Platform service control plane VMs. To do this: 


1. Source the credentials for the Nova account which was used to set up the Helion Developer Platform service by entering: 

		cd /opt/stack/tripleo-ansible 
		scripts/dev-platform/restart_dev_platform_instances.bash 
   

1. Since you have already sourced correct overcloud Nova credentials, you can simply verify the status of Helion Developer Platform service VMs by running the <code>nova list</code> command and checking the status field. 



1. To start the Helion Development Platform service, enter:

		ansible-playbook \
			--extra-vars dev_plat_service=<service> \
			--private-key <path to SSH private key> \
			-u heat-admin \
			-i plugins/inventory/dev_platform_heat.py \
			playbooks/dev-platform/dev_platform_start.yml
