# HP Helion 1.2 Development Platform: Application Lifecycle Service User Guide {#helion-user-guide}
[See the Helion 1.0 Development Platform version of this page](/als/v1/user/)

Application Lifecycle Service is a polyglot Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). You can easily
deploy applications written in a wide range of languages and web
frameworks using a variety of data services simply by pushing your
source code to the system.

Application Lifecycle Service handles the automatic configuration of the language runtime,
web server, application dependencies, databases, and other services.
