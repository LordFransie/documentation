# HP Helion 1.2 Development Platform: Dancer {#dancer}

An app using the Dancer framework needs an *app.psgi* and
*requirements.txt* file.

In the *requirements.txt* file, list any module requirements, with at
least:

    Dancer
    Plack::Request
    YAML

In the *app.psgi* file, for a simple implementation:

    use Dancer;
    get '/' => sub { "hello world!" };
    dance;

### Examples {#examples}

-   [Dancer Hello World](https://github.com/Stackato-Apps/dancer-helloworld): Hello
    World sample.
