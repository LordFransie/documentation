# HP Helion 1.2 Development Platform: Installing the Marketplace Horizon UI

The Marketplace is a repository where teams can download the latest services they need to accelerate development of their applications. 

This document shows how to update the Marketplace service by adding the Horizon UI.

## Step 1: Retrieve the Marketplace Service Update from CODN

Use the **Helion Development Platform UI** to check CODN for a new Service Update for Marketplace.

If there is a new Service Update for Marketplace, retrieve it from CODN. This will retrieve the Marketplace package from CODN and push it into a container in Swift within your local cloud.

## Step 2: Install the Marketplace Service Update

### Preparation

You will need the following pieces of information in order to run the Marketplace Service Update.

<table width="100%">
  <tr><th><p>Identifier</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th></tr>
  <tr><td><p>BASE_NODE_IP</p></td><td><p>The IP address of the base node for your Helion installation.</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p>SEED_NODE_IP</p></td><td><p>The IP address of the seed node for your Helion installation.</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p>USERNAME</p></td><td><p>The username of a cloud admin that has rights to perform an HDP Marketplace Service Update.</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p>PASSWORD</p></td><td><p>The password of a cloud admin that has rights to perform an HDP Marketplace Service Update.</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p>HEAT_ADMIN_KEY</p></td><td><p>The private key file for the <strong>heat-admin</strong> user. <br />
Usually available within the root user account on the seed node here: ~/.ssh/id_rsa</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p>CONTAINER_NAME</p></td><td><p>The Swift container that contains the Marketplace service update. <br />
Defaults to <strong>murano-dashboard-horizon-ui</strong>.</p></td></tr>
  <tr><td><p>SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME</p></td><td><p>The filename of the Marketplace service update. <br />
This can typically can be found inside the above container in Swift.</p></td></tr>
</table>

### Let's get to it!

a) SSH to the seed node of your cloud:

<pre>
# SSH to the base node 
ssh USERNAME@BASE_NODE_IP

# Become root
sudo su (will prompt for password)

# SSH to the seed node 
ssh SEED_NODE_IP
</pre>

b) Ensure your environment has the proper credentials to perform the download from Swift:

<pre>
# overcloud credentials needed here 
source admin_over_creds
</pre>

c) Use the Swift client to download the Service Update:

<pre>
# List the contents of the Swift container 
swift list murano-dashboard-horizon-ui

# Take note of the name of the file within the container 
# ex: SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME.tar.gz 

# Download the installation file 
swift download CONTAINER_NAME SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME 
</pre>

d) Once the file is downloaded, unzip/tar the file:

<pre>
tar -zxvf SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME.tar.gz
</pre>

e) Go to the newly created folder and execute the install script, passing in the location of the private key of the <strong>heat-admin</strong> account:

<pre>
# Source undercloud creds 
source admin_under_creds 

# Fire up the install!
cd SERVICE_UPDATE_FILENAME 
./install.sh HEAT_ADMIN_KEY 
</pre>

## Step 3: Configure the service

Return to the **Helion Development Platform UI** and click on "Configure" to configure the service.
