#Resources for Application Developers

HP has created a series of small, simplified sample applications to walk you through understanding and exercising the Development Platform services.

Each sample builds on the previous one and all source code is provided for you to build, deploy, and take apart. Each sample is provided in multiple languages.
 

##Prerequisites - Before you Begin
In order to download and deploy these sample applications, you must have the necessary framework installed and configured.

- HP Helion OpenStack&reg; cloud or micro-cloud deployed
	- [Community](/helion/community/install/)
	- [Commercial](/helion/openstack/install/overview/)
- Application Lifecycle Service [Cluster](/als/v1/admin/cluster/) available
- Logon and password credentials for the cluster.
- Access to  [Helion command-line interface (CLI)](/als/v1/user/client/); this is part of the Helion Developer Platform installation.

 
##Sample Code
For best results, work with each sample in the order that they are provided, as each one builds on the knowledge provided in the previous sample. 
###Java
1. [Hello World](/helion/devplatform/workbook/helloworld/java/) <br>
The Hello World sample is as simple as it gets: Hello World! 

2. [Database as a Service (DBaaS)](/helion/devplatform/workbook/database/java/) <br>
Create a database and execute a query against it.

3. [Messaging as a Service (MSGaaS)](/helion/devplatform/workbook/messaging/java/)<br> Enter, send, and display a brief message.
