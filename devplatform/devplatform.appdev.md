###Sample Workbook
HP has created a [Workbook](/helion/devplatform/workbook) with multiple small sample applications to walk you through understanding and exercising the Development Platform services.

Each sample in the Workbook builds on the previous one and all source code is provided for you to build, deploy, and take apart. Each sample is provided in multiple languages.
