# HP Helion Development Platform Documentation

Welcome! The HP Helion Development Platform is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that helps developers build great cloud-native applications across private and public clouds.  Based on Cloud Foundry&trade; and integrated with HP Helion OpenStack&reg;, the HP Helion Development Platform is open and interoperable, ensuring developers can focus on building the right app for any environment.

This documentation will help you get up to speed on the  Helion Development Platform.  You'll read about the [Application Lifecycle Service (ALS)](/als/v1/) that provides a managed runtime environment for applications. You'll learn about other building block services including [database](/helion/devplatform/createdatabase/), [messaging](/helion/devplatform/messageservice/), and [marketplace](/helion/devplatform/marketplace/).

**Note**: Before installing the Development Platform, you must first install a [Community](/helion/community/install/) or [Commercial](/helion/openstack/install/overview/) HP Helion OpenStack cloud. If you donâ€™t have an OpenStack environment, the fastest way to try Helion Development Platform is through the trial on HP Helion public cloud.
