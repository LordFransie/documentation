# HP Helion Development Platform Documentation

Welcome! The HP Helion Development Platform preview edition is a free add-on for [HP Helion OpenStack&reg; Community](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/cloud/hphelion-openstack-community.html) which provides an integrated development platform that optimizes Cloud Foundry&trade; for OpenStack. 

The Helion Development platform adds the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) layer to speed up application development and testing. PaaS helps application developers, developers extending the functionality of OpenStack services, and administrators get more out of the cloud faster than ever.

##Get Started with the HP Helion Development Platform
Before installing the Development Platform, you must first install [HP Helion OpenStack Community](/helion/community/install-virtual/).

###Resources for Application Developers###
HP has created a [Workbook](/helion/devplatform/workbook) with multiple small sample applications to walk you through understanding and exercising the Development Platform services. Each sample builds on the previous one and all source code is available for you to take apart and examine. Each sample is provided in multiple languages. There are more complex, real-world samples available at the end of the Workbook for you to download and deploy.
