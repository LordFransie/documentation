# HP Helion 1.0 Development Platform: Customization {#customization}
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.1 version of this page](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/admin/console/customize/)

An Application Lifecycle Service PaaS can be extensively customized and themed. PaaS
administrators can add or remove runtimes, frameworks and services from
the system, and change the look and content of the [*Management
Console*](/als/v1/user/console/#management-console) interface.

Console Settings[](#console-settings "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Management Console is modified mainly through the **Settings \>
Console** pages. Settings are saved as variables which can subsequently
be used in HTML pages via the [Embedded JavaScript
(EJS)](http://embeddedjs.com/) templating engine.

### Product[](#product "Permalink to this headline")

-   **Product Name**: Overrides all occurrences of 'Application Lifecycle Service'
-   **Company Name**: Overrides all occurrences of 'HP
    Software'
-   **Vendor Version**: Overrides all occurrences of the Application Lifecycle Service
    version number.
-   **Default Locale**: Sets the default locale of the console if the
    users current locale isn't recognized. Currently, only the 'en'
    localization is complete.
-   **External Docs URL**: The link that directs users to documentation.
    Defaults to the current documentation published to
    docs.hpcloud.com. Ticking 'Use local docs' will cause this URL to
    be ignored and the docs from the VM will be served instead.

### Look and Feel[](#look-and-feel "Permalink to this headline")

-   **Favicon Logo URL**: The favicon to use. Recommended to be 32x32px
    image/png.
-   **Header Logo URL**: The logo image to use in the header. Size can
    vary although anything bigger than 50px vertically may result in
    some distortion of the header (fixable with a custom style sheet).
-   **Footer Logo URL**: The logo image to use in the footer. Same as
    above but height is about 40px before distortion occurs.
-   **Background Color**: Sets the background color of the console.

### Welcome Page[](#welcome-page "Permalink to this headline")

The HTML/EJS to show on the Welcome page. The [*settings-variables*](#customize-settings-vars) and `username`
variable (current user) are available via EJS, but plain HTML will work
for simple use cases.

### Support Page[](#support-page "Permalink to this headline")

The HTML/EJS to show on the Support page. The [*settings-variables*](#customize-settings-vars) and `support_email` variable (see Settings \> Controller) are available.

### Eula Content[](#eula-content "Permalink to this headline")

The HTML/EJS to show in the EULA overlay. The [*settings-variables*](#customize-settings-vars) are available.

### Custom Stylesheet[](#custom-stylesheet "Permalink to this headline")

CSS defined here will be applied to the page after the default CSS has
been loaded, and override/replace any style. Use this to change the
layout and color of any element in the Management Console. Use web
development tools like Firebug or Chrome DevTools to inspect elements
and find the relevant styles.

### Settings Variables[](#settings-variables "Permalink to this headline")

The following variables (with their default values) are available in the
EJS templates on the settings object (e.g.
`settings.product_name`):

-   product\_name: null,
-   company\_name: 'HP Software',
-   vendor\_version: '3.0',
-   default\_locale: 'en',
-   product\_logo\_favicon\_url: 'img/helion\_logo\_favicon.png',
-   product\_logo\_header\_url: 'img/helion\_logo\_header.png',
-   product\_logo\_footer\_url: 'img/helion\_logo\_footer.png',
-   background\_color: '\#ffffff',
-   style: '',
-   support\_template: SupportTemplate,
-   eula\_template: EulaTemplate,
-   welcome\_template: WelcomeTemplate,
-   external\_docs\_url:
    '[http://docs.helion.com/3.0/](../..)',
-   use\_local\_docs: "false"

### Restoring values[](#restoring-values "Permalink to this headline")

Each setting has an individual **Load Default** button (refresh icon to
the left of the value field) which will replace the customized value
with the default for that setting. Click 'Save' to apply the changes.

The red **Load Defaults** button at the top of the page deletes all
customizations and loads defaults for all settings.

As a failsafe for when style changes have obscured the interface, admins
can also reset specific settings by loading a URL with the following
format:

    https://<helion-url>/#settings/console/reset/setting_name

Replace `setting_name` with one of the variables
above and that value will be reset to the default.

Renaming the Client[](#renaming-the-client "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `helion` client is distributed as a single
file executable for Windows, OS X and Linux (x86 and x86\_64). Zip files
containing executables for each platform can be found in the
`~/helion/static` directory.

After renaming the executable, you can re-package them in .zip files and
modify the
*\~/helion/code/console/js/views/client/templates/client.html*
template to point to the renamed files.
