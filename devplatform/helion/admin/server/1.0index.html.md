# HP Helion 1.0 Development Platform: Server Configuration {#server-configuration}
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.1 version of this page](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/admin/server/)

This page covers the initial setup and configuration of the Application Lifecycle Service
Server in a virtual machine under control of a hypervisor running on a
virtualization host.

##Accessing Server via the Command Line {#accessing-server-via-the-command-line}

The Application Lifecycle Service server initially has one user account. The default login information is:

* Username: stackato
* Password: helion

Unless you've already created a primary admin user in the Management Console. If so, the password of the default Helion account is changed to match that of the first user created in the Management Console, and you'll need to use that password instead. 

**Security Note**: If the Application Lifecycle Service server is running on a publicly routable network, the password should be changed as soon as possible.

**Note**

 If the cluster was created using the Horizon Management Console Panel or Application Lifecycle Service Installer CLI, you must log in with your SSH key you selected during cluster creation.

Command access to the Application Lifecycle Service server is available in several ways:

-   Over the hypervisor's [tty console](/als/v1/user/reference/glossary/#term-tty-console).

-   The [Application Lifecycle Service Client](/als/v1/user/reference/client-ref/#command-ref-client) command, which in addition to specialized functions can provide remote shell access to the server:

        helion target helion@helion-xxxx.local
        helion ssh api

-   The familiar `ssh` command:

        ssh helion@helion-xxxx.local

**Note**
<!-- For ssh access on Windows, we recommend [MSYS](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mingw-w64/wiki/MSYS).-->

On the server, the control command for Application Lifecycle Service is called
`kato`. It is used for configuration and node
management procedures such as start, stop, role specialization, and
status checks. For a complete list of options, see the [Kato Command Reference](/als/v1/admin/reference/kato-ref/).
