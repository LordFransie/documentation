# HP Helion 1.1 Development Platform: Remote Debugging {#remote-debugging}
[See the Helion 1.0 Development Platform version of this page](/als/v1/user/deploy/app-debug/)

Different languages have different tools and protocols for remote
debugging, but most require a connection between the running application
code and the debugging tool or IDE on a port and protocol other than
standard HTTP(S).

Application Lifecycle Service makes this possible through the [Harbor port
service](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/services/port-service/#port-service), and the
[*push*](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/reference/client-ref/#command-push) command has
a `-d` option to set up port forwarding for a remote
debugging session automatically.

See the [JPDA Debugging](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/deploy/languages/java/#java-web-debug) section
of the Java deployment documentation for an example.

HELION\_DEBUG\_COMMAND[](#helion-debug-command "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The command-line client can automatically start a local debugger client or IDE instance with connection information for a newly pushed application.

When the `-d` debugging option is given to
[*push*](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/reference/client-ref/#command-push) command,
the client looks for a HELION\_DEBUG\_COMMAND environment variable. If
present, the command specified in that variable is run after the push
completes as child process in the foreground (i.e. blocking the parent
`helion` process) in the local application source
directory.

Special `%HOST%` and `%PORT%` variables can be used in this command, which
are replaced with the hostname or IP address and port number of the new
Harbor debugging service.
