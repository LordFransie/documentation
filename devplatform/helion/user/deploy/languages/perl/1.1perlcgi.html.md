# HP Helion 1.1: Development Platform Perl CGI {#perl-cgi}

The *perlcgi* framework can be used to run *any* CGI script, but, like the [perl](index.html#perl-index) framework, it provides ActivePerl in the default PATH and supports module installation via [PPM](index.html#perl-ppm) and [*cpanm*](index.html#perl-cpanm).

Unlike the perl framework, setting the [*start-file*](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/deploy/manifestyml/#start-file) option
has no effect, as there is no permanently running application. A new
instance of a CGI script is started for each request.

Perl scripts deployed with this framework should begin with:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

## Example {#example}

-   [perlcgi-env](https://github.com/Stackato-Apps/perlcgi-env): A simple Perl CGI script that displays environment variables.
