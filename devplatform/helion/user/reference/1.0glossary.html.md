[See the Helion 1.1 Development Platform version of this page](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/reference/glossary/)
==================================================

AMQP
:   Acronym for [Advanced Message Queuing
    Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol).

Apache ANT
:   A software tool for automating software build processes. See
    [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) for more info.

Apache Maven
:   A build automation tool typically used for Java projects. See
    [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for more info.

app
:   Any application software intended for instantiation in Application Lifecycle Service. At
    minimum it consists of the application, expressed in a dynamic
    language, plus a configuration file named 
    *manifest.yml*.

Avahi
:   An implementation of [*multicast DNS*](#term-multicast-dns) and
    related protocols.

cluster
:   A set of interconnected physical processors or virtual machines,
    managed at least conceptually as a single entity but otherwise
    operating autonomously. Historically the term carried a variety of
    proprietary meanings, but came into general use with the rapid
    development of supercomputing based upon [Beowulf
    Clusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster). An Application Lifecycle Service
    cluster is one in which [*role*](#term-role)s are assigned or
    replicated to multiple cluster [*node*](#term-node)s.

component
:   Within Application Lifecycle Service, the term **component** is used when naming a
    discrete part of the Application Lifecycle Service server. For example, a
    [*role*](#term-role) is made up of one or more components.

container
:   A lightweight form of virtualization which provides resource
    isolation and secure separation for multiple instances of the same
    base system. According to circumstances it may be used in addition
    to or instead of hypervisor virtualization.

CPAN
:   Acronym for [Comprehensive Perl Archive
    Network](http://www.cpan.org/).

doozerd
:   A consistent distributed data store. Used for cluster management in
    Application Lifecycle Service. (see [Doozer project on
    GitHub](https://github.com/ha/doozerd/#readme))

DHCP
:   [Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol).
    The DHCP service is used to allocate IP addresses to clients on
    demand and to supply other basic network information they need, such
    as the addresses of a default router and DNS server.

DNS
:   [Domain Name
    System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). Resolves
    domain names to IP addresses.

dnsmasq
:   A [lightweight server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq) for
    locally integrating DNS with DHCP/BOOTP.

dynamic DNS
:   A means of rapidly updating the Domain Name System, possibly making
    use of [**RFC 2136**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136)
    Dynamic Updates.

filesystem
:   In Application Lifecycle Service, **filesystem** refers to persistent storage accessed by
    an application :term\`service\` specified in *manifest.yml* through
    a server which has been assigned the filesystem
    [*role*](#term-role).

JSON
:   A notation for structured text data, acronym for [JavaScript Object
    Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

MBUS
:   Application Lifecycle Service's implementation of an [**RFC
    3259**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3259) message queue used
    for interprocess communication. *See also:* [*NATS*](#term-nats).

memcached
:   Free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object
    caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding
    up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. (see
    [Memcached project page](http://memcached.org/))

micro cloud
:   A preconfigured Application Lifecycle Service virtual machine image consisting of a
    single generic [*node*](#term-node) enabled for all the
    [*role*](#term-role)s necessary for basic operation, but with no
    preinstalled [*app*](#term-app)s or [*service*](#term-service)s.

mongodb
:   A popular [noSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database
    management system.

multicast DNS
:   A distributed means of configuring DNS by [multicast
    discovery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS). It is
    supported on Application Lifecycle Service :term\`micro cloud\` servers using
    [*Avahi*](#term-avahi).

mysql
:   A relational database management system.

NAT
:   Acronym for [Network Address
    Translation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation).

NATS
:   In Application Lifecycle Service, a publish-subscribe message system implemented as a
    process called `nats-server` which listens on a
    network interface, normally on port 4222/tcp. Messages published
    across the network to a particular [*MBUS*](#term-mbus) queue
    managed by the nats-server are communicated to clients which are
    subscribed to that queue.

Nginx
:   [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/) is a high-performance, event-driven
    web server.

node
:   An Application Lifecycle Service **node** is a single processing host in a
    [*cluster*](#term-cluster), typically a virtual machine running
    under a hypervisor.

OVF
:   Acronym for [Open Virtualization
    Format](http://dmtf.org/standards/ovf), a specification for virtual
    machine images developed by the DMTF industry consortium.

PaaS
:   Acronym for [Platform as a
    Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service).

pip
:   A tool for installing and managing Python packages, such as those
    found in the Python Package Index. It's a replacement for
    easy\_install. See
    [pip-installer](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) for more
    information.

PyPM
:   PyPM is the *binary* package manager for ActivePython. It is usually
    the fastest and most reliable way of installing PyPI packages for
    your Application Lifecycle Service applications. The PyPM repository hosts almost all of
    the Python packages registered in PyPI and includes their latest
    versions. See [PyPM](http://code.activestate.com/pypm) for more
    information.

Polipo
:   A lightweight caching web proxy intended for small applications.

postgresql
:   A relational database management system.

private PaaS
:   A private [*PaaS*](#term-paas) is one which is hosted on your
    private cloud, behind your firewall.

RabbitMQ
:   A [message broker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker)
    subsystem which implements [*AMQP*](#term-amqp).

Redis
:   An implementation of memory resident key-value store.

resolvconf
:   A system configuration tool typically used by hook scripts at boot
    time. See the [resolvconf man
    page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/man8/resolvconf.8)
    for details.

role
:   Each [*node*](#term-node) in an Application Lifecycle Service [*cluster*](#term-cluster)
    may be assigned certain selectable capabilities within the Application Lifecycle Service
    architecture. These capabilities are called **roles**, and are
    usually denoted in lowercase. Examples of essential roles are
    **router**, **primary**, **controller**, and **dea**. In addition,
    there are **role groups** (for convenience) such as
    **data-services** that represent all data-services. (postgresql
    mysql rabbit mongodb redis filesystem memcached)

service
:   In Application Lifecycle Service, a **service** is a type of [*role*](#term-role) that
    may be provisioned on a server and accessed by an application as
    specified in *manifest.yml*.

supervisord
:   A process control system used by Application Lifecycle Service internally. (see
    [Supervisor project page](http://supervisord.org/))

tty console
:   The hypervisor window which provides serial console access to one of
    its virtual machines.

YAML
:   A notation for structured text data, acronym for [YAML Ain't Markup
    Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), used in*manifest.yml* configuration files.
