User-Provided Services[](#user-provided-services "Permalink to this headline")
===============================================================================

User-provided service instances allow you connect applications running
on Application Lifecycle Service to specified external data services, without hard coding the
credentials into the application. The service instance provides the
connection information to the application via the VCAP\_SERVICES environment variables, just like the [*built-in data
services*](/als/v1/user/services/data-services/#data-services).

Think of user-provided services as a credentials database for your
Application Lifecycle Service application space. You provide the connection information,
Application Lifecycle Service stores it in a [*JSON object*](#user-provided-using) which can
be bound any applications in the space.

Creating[](#creating "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------

User-provided service instances will typically be used to connect
applications hosted on Application Lifecycle Service to existing external database hosts or
clusters. For example, to connect an app to a PostgreSQL database hosted
outside of Application Lifecycle Service:

    $ helion create-service user-provided prod-db-int
    Which credentials to use for connections [hostname, port, password]: host, port, database, user, pass
    host: dbhost1.example.com
    port: 5432
    database: prod-django-321
    user: ro-web
    pass: vsTLP2gs
    Creating new service ... OK

The parameter names provided in the first step will become the keys in
the JSON object exposed to the application later.

Binding[](#binding "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------

Once the service instance has been created it can be bound to
applications, just like any other service:

    $ helion bind-service prod-db-int django-cms
    Binding prod-db-int to scaling-demo ...
    Stopping Application [django-cms] ... OK
    Starting Application [django-cms] ...
    OK
    http://django-cms.helion.example.com/ deployed

Using[](#using "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------

The `helion service` command will show the
credentials:

    $ helion service prod-db-int

    prod-db-int

    | - pass       | vsTLP2gs                     |
    | - port       | 5432                         |
    | - user       | ro-web                       |
    |              |                              |
    | Applications | django-cms                   |
    +--------------+------------------------------+

The [*VCAP\_SERVICES*](/als/v1/user/services/data-services/#database-services-vcap-services)
variables will expose the connection information within the application
container. The parameter names you provided when setting up the service
instance become the keys in the `prod-db-int` JSON
object:

    django-cms$ echo VCAP_SERVICES |json
    {
      "prod-db-int": {
        "database": "prod-django-321",
        "host": "dbhost1.example.com",
        "pass": "vsTLP2gs",
        "port": "5432",
        "user": "ro-web"
      }
    }

To have your application use this information, parse the variable in
your application code to extract the credentials at runtime. See the
[*Language Specific
Deployment*](/als/v1/user/deploy/#language-specific-deploy) section for
examples.

Frameworks or buildpacks that autoconfigure bound services will do so
automatically, as they would for system-provided data services.
