Buildpacks[](#buildpacks "Permalink to this headline")
=======================================================

[Buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) are
bundles of detection and configuration scripts which set up containers
to run applications. For a short introduction to writing buildpacks, see
[this presentation](http://talks.codegram.com/heroku-buildpacks).

Deploy Using Buildpacks[](#deploy-using-buildpacks "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buildpacks are the recommended method for deploying applications to
Application Lifecycle Service. Buildpacks replace the built-in frameworks used in previous versions.

### Built-In Buildpacks[](#built-in-buildpacks "Permalink to this headline")

For convenience, a few buildpacks are bundled with Application Lifecycle Service:

-   [Python](https://github.com/HP/helion-buildpack-python)
-   [Java](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack)
-   [Node.js](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/heroku-buildpack-nodejs)
-   [Ruby](https://github.com/HP/helion-buildpack-ruby)

Application Lifecycle Service will cycle through the `detect` scripts of
the built-in buildpacks prior to staging to match the code you are
pushing.

### Legacy Buildpack[](#legacy-buildpack "Permalink to this headline")

The legacy buildpack is a special meta-buildpack for deploying applications configured for Cloud Foundry v1 without the need for extensive reconfiguration.

To use the Legacy buildpack: specify the `framework` type for your application (e.g. php,
play, rails3, sinatra, java\_web, java\_ee, etc.). You can optionally
set a specific `runtime:` as well. For example:

    name: bottle-py3
    framework:
      type: python
      runtime: python32

**Note**

When using the Legacy Buildpack, config-defined environment variable
values can only be updated by re-pushing the application with new
settings (see [*Legacy Buildpack and Environment
Variables*](/als/v1/admin/reference/known-issues/#known-issues-legacy-env)).

### Custom Buildpacks[](#custom-buildpacks "Permalink to this headline")

To specify the exact buildpack to use for deploying your application,
set a top-level `buildpack:` key in *manifest.yml*
to the URL of the buildpack's Git repository. For example:

    name: myrubyapp
    mem: 256MB
    buildpack: https://github.com/ActiveState/stackato-buildpack-ruby.git

**Note**

Not all Heroku buildpacks work with Application Lifecycle Service due to environmental
differences (e.g. relying on certain executables or libraries in
Heroku-specific locations). Test any buildpack before using it in
production deployments.

The following buildpacks are known to work with Application Lifecycle Service:

-   [Jekyll](https://github.com/ActiveState/stackato-buildpack-jekyll/)
-   [PyPy](https://github.com/ActiveState/stackato-buildpack-pypy)
-   [Python and
    Django](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python) -
    [unofficial
    documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python)
-   [Scala](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-scala) -
    [unofficial
    documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/scala)
-   [Sphinx
    Documentation](https://github.com/craigkerstiens/heroku-buildpack-sphinx)
    -   [Sphinx example](https://github.com/Stackato-Apps/sphinx-demo)

**Note**

Using `config_vars` in a buildpack's *bin/release*
to set environment variables has been deprecated. [Use a shell script in
\$HOME/.profile.d](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/profiled)
instead.

### Pet-Clinic (Java)[](#pet-clinic-java "Permalink to this headline")

First, in `manifest.yml` you will need to define the
the buildpack url. Here is the pet-clinic manifest.yml:

    name: pet-clinic
    mem: 512M
    buildpack: https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-java.git
    services:
      ${name}-db: mysql

As it is a buildpack application, you also need to create a
`Procfile` in which you declare how you want your
application to be executed. Here is the one from pet-clinic:

    web: java $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar --port $PORT target/*.war

And finally, add the jetty dependency in your `pom.xml` in order to run your application:

    <build>
        ...
        <plugins>
            ...
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.3</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>package</phase>
                        <goals><goal>copy</goal></goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <artifactItems>
                                <artifactItem>
                                    <groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
                                    <artifactId>jetty-runner</artifactId>
                                    <version>7.5.4.v20111024</version>
                                    <destFileName>jetty-runner.jar</destFileName>
                                </artifactItem>
                            </artifactItems>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
