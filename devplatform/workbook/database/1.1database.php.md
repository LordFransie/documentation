# HP Helion 1.1 Development Platform: PHP MySQL Database Sample
[See the Helion OpenStack 1.0 version of this page](/helion/devplatform/workbook/database/php/)
This very simple PHP web app displays the text "Executed query "SELECT "Hello World!"".", and then the result of that query "Hello World!" This is a demonstration of the minimum requirements to build an application that can connect to a MySQL database provided by ALS and run queries against it. Use this sample to ensure that you have set up your environment for connecting to and working with MySQL on the Helion Development Platform. 
 
## Prerequisites
- An installation of the [HP Helion Development Platform](/helion/devplatform/1.1/install/).
- Access to an Application Lifecycle Service (ALS) [Cluster](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/admin/cluster/)
- Access to the [Helion command-line client (CLI)](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/client/).
- Access to the web-based [ALS Management Console](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/console/).
- The MySQL service is not enabled by default. Check and [make sure it is enabled](#enablemysql).
- Register for access to the [HP Helion Development Platform](https://helion.hpwsportal.com/catalog.html#/Home/Show) (HDN).

## One-Button Deployment to HP Helion
You can deploy this app automatically with the button below or with the manual 
instructions further down. But before you push the button, ensure that you have taken care of the [prerequisites](#prereq).

## Deployment Instructions

### Enable the MySQL Service {#enablemysql}

If the MySQL service is not enabled on your cluster, or if you are not sure, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Administrative console for your ALS cluster. <br />For example: *https://api.xx.xx.xx.xx.xip.io*, substitute your own cluster's link.
2. On the **Admin** tab, click **Cluster**.
3. Click the **Settings** icon (a gear icon in the upper right corner)
4. The **MySQL** check box should be checked. If it is not, check it.
5. Click **Save**.

**Note**: If a more durable or scalable MySQL database service is needed, configure your ALS cluster to use a database instance or master/slave pair provided by the Database Service. For more information, refer to [Using the Database Service](/helion/devplatform/1.1/databaseservice/) and [Connecting the Database Service with ALS](/helion/devplatform/1.1/connectdatabase/). 

###Download the Application Files
[Click here to access the code repository](https://github.com/HelionDevPlatform/helion-mysql-php/).

*Manifest.yml* is a configuration file used to specify settings. For PHP, only the **name** and **buildpack** fields are required. The **buildpack** field is a URL for the buildpack that supports the necessary language and/or framework.

This app uses the [Cloud Foundry PHP buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack). For more technical details about buildpacks and the *composer.json* file, please see the README included in the [download package](https://github.com/HelionDevPlatform/helion-mysql-php/).

###Deploy the Application
**Note**: Application Lifecycle Service clusters that require an upstream HTTP proxy to access the internet will need to be [made aware of the proxy](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/admin/server/configuration/#staging-cache-app-http-proxy). The sample applications require access to the Internet in order to download dependent packages. 

Use the Helion client to deploy your app to Helion Development Platform.  If you have Eclipse installed, you have the option to use the [plugin](/helion/devplatform/1.1/eclipse/).

1.	Open the [Helion command-line interface (CLI)](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/reference/client-ref/)
3.	Ensure that you are targeting your desired environment.  <br /> If you are not, execute
	
		helion target https://api.xx.xx.xx.xx.example.com2.	


1. Ensure that you are logged in to your desired environment.  <br />If you are not, execute
	
		helion login
	
4.	If you are not already there, `cd` to the root directory of the sample.
5.	Deploy the application by using the command:
	
		helion push
	
6.	Accept any default values that you may be prompted for.
	<br />	**Note**: By default ALS clusters are configured with two domains (private and public). In some situations the Helion CLI may prompt you to select a target domain. If prompted, select the public domain from the given list (i.e. *<app-name>.xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.xip.io*)

### View and Run the Application
1. Open the Helion Management Console. This is the web-based administrative interface. 
2. Click **Applications**. 
3.	If the file push was successful, you should see **mysql-php** in the list of available applications.
4.	In the upper right-hand corner, click **View App** to see your app in action.
	-  This app connects to the MySQL service, executes a query, and displays a page showing the retrieved text.  

##Key Code Snippets
This first line in this section of the index.php file shows how to retrieve the connection information for the MySQL instance from the application's environment variables. The connection information is represented using JSON. 

The rest of the code shown here parses the JSON string that was retrieved and builds the appropriate connection string. Once the connection has been made, the code executes a query, reads the results, and closes the connection. 


	$services = getenv('VCAP_SERVICES');

	$json = json_decode($services, TRUE);

	// Parse the json string that we got from VCAP_SERVICES
	// The only top-level node will be mysql since it's the only service bound to
	// this sample app.
	// Note that some of the fields are optional but are included for reference
	$dbname = $json['mysql'][0]['credentials']['name'];
	$hostname = $json['mysql'][0]['credentials']['hostname'];
	$user = $json['mysql'][0]['credentials']['user'];
	$password = $json['mysql'][0]['credentials']['password'];
	$port = $json['mysql'][0]['credentials']['port'];

	// Create a connection to MySQL
	echo "\n <br /> Connecting to MySQL...";
	$connection = mysqli_connect($hostname, $user, $password, $dbname, $port);
		
	// Check connection 
	if (mysqli_connect_errno()) { 
	echo "\n <br /> Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error(); 
	echo "\n <br />Connected to MySQL!"; } 
	
	// Execute a simple query to grab a string 
		$queryString = "SELECT \"Hello World!\" AS result"; 
		$result = mysqli_query($connection, $queryString); 
		echo "\n <br /> Executed $queryString"; 
	
	// Get the result 
	$row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result); 
	echo "\n <br /> Result: " . $row['result']; 
	echo "\n <br /> Error: Result of query is NULL!"; 

	// Free up the memory that was allocated to the result 
	mysqli_free_result($result); 
	
	// Finally, close the MySQL connection. 
	mysqli_close($con); 

The *manifest.yml* file contains the configuration information used by ALS to set up the environment. The **services** element informs ALS on how to bind to the MySQL service provided by the ALS cluster to the application. The file also uses the **buildpack** element that is used by ALS to configure the application environment for using PHP.

		- name: mysql-php
		buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack.git 
		services: 
			${name}-db: 
				type: mysql 
##Key Learnings
1. ALS requires configuration information so that it can bind to a MySQL service. Configuration information is contained in the *manifest.yml* file.
1. You will need to provide information about which build pack to use for PHP so that ALS can create an environment for your app. Configuration information is contained in the *manifest.yml* file.
1. You will need to retrieve connection information for MySQL from the application's environment variables and then parse that information into a connection string that can be used by PHP.
1. You interact with and deploy your app using the [ALS client](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/reference/client-ref/), the web-based [ALS Management Console](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/user/console/), or the [Eclipse plugin](/helion/devplatform/1.1/eclipse/).
