#PHP MySQL Database Sample
This very simple Node.js web application displays the text "Executed query "SELECT "Hello World!"".", and then the result of that query: "Hello World". This is a demonstration of the minimum requirements to build an application that can connect to a MySQL database provided by ALS and run queries against it. Use this sample to ensure that you have set up your environment for connecting to and working with MySQL on the Helion Development Platform. 

## Prerequisites
If you are missing any of these items, you will need to [install them](/helion/devplatform/appdev/).

1.	You must have access to an ALS cluster.
2.	The Helion command-line interface (CLI) must be installed.
3.	You must have access to the web-based Helion Management console.

###MySQL

If the MySQL service is not enabled on your cluster, or if you are not sure, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Administrative console for your ALS cluster. <br>For example: *https://api.xx.xx.xx.xx.xip.io*, substitute your own clusterâ€™s link.
2. On the **Admin** tab, click **Cluster**.
3. Click the **Settings** icon (a gear icon in the upper right corner)
4. The **MySQL** check box should be checked. If it is not, check it.
5. Click **Save**.

**Note**: If a more durable or scalable MySQL database service is needed, configure your ALS cluster to use a database instance or master/slave pair provided by the Database Service. For more information, refer to [Creating a Database Instance in the Database Service](/helion/devplatform/createdatabase/) and [Connecting the Database Service with ALS](/helion/devplatform/connectdatabase/). 

##Download the Application Files
[Click here to access the download directory](https://gitlab.gozer.hpcloud.net/developer-experience/mysql-php/).

##Deploy the Application
Use the Helion client to deploy your app to Helion Development Platform.  If you have Eclipse installed, you have the option to use the [plugin](/helion/devplatform/eclipse/).

1.	Open the [Helion command-line interface (CLI)](/als/v1/user/reference/client-ref/)
2.	Ensure that you are logged in to your desired environment.  <br>If you are not, execute `helion login` 
3.	Ensure that you are targeting your desired environment.  <br> If you are not, execute `helion target https://api.xx.xx.xx.xx.example.com`
4.	If you are not already there, `cd` to the root directory of the sample.
5.	Execute `helion push -n`
6.	Accept any default values that you may be prompted for.
	<br>	**Note**: By default ALS clusters are configured with two domains (private and public). In some situations the Helion CLI may prompt you to select a target domain. If prompted, select the public domain from the given list (i.e. <app-name>.xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.xip.io)

##Run the Application
1.	Open the Helion Management Console. <br> The Management Console is the web-based administrative interface that can be reached by typing the ALS endpoint URL into a browser window.
2.	Click **Applications**.
3.	If the file push was successful, you should see **mysql-php** in the list of available applications.

##Key Learnings
1.	You need to provide configuration information so that ALS can bind to a MySQL service.
2.	You need to retrieve connection information for MySQL from the application's environment variables, and parse the information into a JDBC compliant connection string.
3.	You interact with and deploy your app using the Helion CLI or the Eclipse [plugin](/helion/devplatform/eclipse/).
