#HP Helion Development Platform Workbook Messaging Sample
Before you can begin working with the samples, ensure that you have met the technical prerequisites.

This is the **third** sample in the Workbook; if you have not already examined the [HelloWorld](/helion/workbook/helloWorld/) sample and the [Database sample](/helion/workbook/database/), please do those two first.

**Technical Prerequisites**

1. You must have a Stackato instance available. <br>If necessary, create one.
2. Ensure that the  Stackato command-line interface (CLI) is installed. <br> If not, install it.
3. Ensure that RabbitMQ service is enabled. <br> Stackato 3.4 appears have it enabled by default but Stackato 3.2 does not. 
	- Go to the console (e.g. *https://api.15.126.212.172.xip.io*, substitute your own instance's link)
	- >what console? the admin console? horizon?
	- On the **Admin** tab, click **Cluster**.
	- Click the **Settings** icon (a gear icon in the upper/lower? right corner)
	- If the **Rabbit**/**Rabbit3** check box is not checked, click it to check it.
	- Click **Save**.
