#Node Messaging Sample
Before you can begin working with the samples, ensure that you have met the technical prerequisites.

This is the **third** sample in the Workbook; if you have not already examined the [HelloWorld](/helion/workbook/helloWorld/) sample and the [Database sample](/helion/workbook/database/), please do those two first.
##Prerequisites
**Stackato**

1. You must have a Stackato instance available. 
2. The  [Stackato command-line interface (CLI)](http://docs.stackato.com/user/client/index.html#client) must be installed. 
3. The RabbitMQ service must be enabled. <br> Stackato 3.4 appears have it enabled by default, but Stackato 3.2 does not. 
	- Go to the Administrative console (e.g. *https://api.15.126.212.172.xip.io*, substitute your own instance's link)
	- On the **Admin** tab, click **Cluster**.
	- Click the **Settings** icon (a gear icon in the upper right corner)
	- Both of the **Rabbit** and **Rabbit3** check boxes should be checked. If they are not, check them.
	- Click **Save**.
