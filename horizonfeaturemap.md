#Feature Mapping: HP Classic Console to the HP Public Cloud Console

HP encourages you to transition to HP Public Cloud 13.5 as soon as possible. The 13.5 version allows you to take advantage of significant product enhancements, including the new HP Public Cloud Console based on the OpenStack Horizon dashboard project.  Early transition also ensures uninterrupted service when support for the previous (12.12) version ends on June 1, 2014.

As of January 29, 2014, you can only manage your 13.5 services and update your account information through the HP Public Cloud Console. This document maps the feature changes from the HP Classic Console to the new HP Public Cloud Console and provides links to other relevant information.
