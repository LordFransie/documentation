# HP Cloud Monitoring Overview

HP Cloud Monitoring provides you with a managed service that facilitates your monitoring of the health and other metrics for the resources in HP Cloud.  

The HP Cloud Monitoring service is currently in private beta.  Please [request access on our sign-up page](https://account.hpcloud.com/cases/betarequest/maas).  Service use is free of charge during the private beta period.

## API
Do you need low level, raw REST API access to HP Cloud MaaS?  Take a look at the [Monitoring v1.1 API page](/api/v13/monitoring/).
