# Management console account and services dashboard

This page provides you with an overview of the management console (MC) account and services dashboard, which allows you to display and manage your account and services information.  This page covers the following topics:

* [Account and services dashboard overview](Overview)
* [Navigating to the other account and services screens](Navigating)
* [For further information](#ForFurtherInformation)

##Account and services dashboard overview## {#Overview}

The account and services dashboard provides you with quick access for managing your account and services details.  If you launch the dashboard by, in the `Account` menu, selecting `Manage Services`, the services screen is displayed:

The screen has a pane for each available region, and displays which services you have for each region, their availability zone (AZ), status (`active` or `not active`), and provides a activation/management button to allow you to either activate the service, or enter the [MC compute dashboard](/mc/compute/).  If a particular service or AZ is not available to you, there is no button in the `Action` column of the pane.

If you launch the dashboard by, in the `Account` menu, selecting `My Account`, the account overview screen is displayed:

This screen is a listing of your personal account information.  You can use this screen to edit your name or email address.

For all the functions available from the MC account and services dashboard, you can navigate to the appropriate screen by selecting an item from the right-hand navigation bar:
