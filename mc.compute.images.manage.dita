# Management Console: Managing Images

This page describes how to create and delete images using the [images screen](/mc/compute/images/) of the [management console](/mc/) (MC).  This page covers the following topics:

* [Before you begin](#Overview)
* [Creating an image](#Creating)
* [Deleting an image](#Deleting)
* [Viewing image details](#Viewing)
* [For further information](#ForFurtherInformation)


##Before you begin## {#Overview}

Before you can begin creating or deleting an image, you must:

* [Sign up for an HP Helion Public Cloud compute account](https://horizon.hpcloud.com/register)
* [Activate compute service on your account](https://horizon.hpcloud.com/landing/)


##Creating an image ## {#Creating}

To create an image, in the [images screen](/mc/compute/images/) click the `+ New Image` menu bar item:

<img src="media/images-new.png" width="580" alt="" />

This opens the image creation pane in the images screen:

<img src="media/images-create-pane.png" width="580" alt="" />

In the images creation pane, enter a name for your image in the `Image Name` text input field, and (optionally) a description of your image in the `Description` field.  In the `From server` pulldown, select the server from which you would like to create your image.  

Click the `Create` button to create the image with your entered parameters.  The images creation pane closes, and your new image appears in the images list:

<img src="media/image-created.png" width="580" alt="" />

The image appears in the list immediately with the status of `Queued`; while your image is being created, the `Status` changes to `Saving` and finally `Active`.


##Deleting an image## {#Deleting}

To delete an existing image, in the [images screen](/mc/compute/images/), in the row for the image you want to delete, in the `Manage` column click the `Options` button and select `Delete`:

<img src="media/image-delete.png" width="580" alt="" />

A dialog appears to ensure you want to delete that image:

<img src="media/image-delete-verify.png" width="580" alt="" />

Select `Yes, delete this image` to delete the image; the image is removed and no longer appears in the images list.

Your can also delete an image by clicking the `Delete` button in the [custom image details](#Viewing) screen for that image.


##Viewing image details## {#Viewing}

To access the image details screen, in the [images screen](/mc/compute/images/), in the row for the image you want to delete, in the `Manage` column click the `Options` button and select `Image Details` 

<img src="media/images-details-launch.png" width="580" alt="" />

This launches the custom images details screen:

<img src="media/image-details.png" width="580" alt="" />

The custom image details screen displays the name, ID, status (active or inactive), description, size, container format (e.g. `BARE`), disk format, creation date, and source server for your image.  You can [delete the image](#Deleting) from this screen by clicking the `Delete` button.
