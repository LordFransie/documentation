# Management console: Images screen

The management console (MC) compute dashboard images screen allows you to view and manipulate compute instance images.  This page covers the following topics:

* [Images screen overview](#Overview)
* [For further information](#ForFurtherInformation)

##Images screen overview## {#Overview}

The images screen displays your compute instance image information for the availability zone (AZ) you have selected.

<img src="media/images-main.jpg" width="580" alt="" />

The name, status, size, and source server for your images are displayed.  You can sort your list of images based on a particular identifier by just clicking the column heading.  For example, if you want to sort by status, just click the `Status` column header.

Clicking the `+ New Image` button opens the [new image pane](/mc/compute/images/manage#Creating) in the images screen:

<img src="media/images-create-pane.png" width="580" alt="" />

From the images screen you can:

* [Create an image](/mc/compute/images/manage#Creating)
* [Delete an image](/mc/compute/images/manage#Deleting)
* [View image details](/mc/compute/images/manage#Viewing)
