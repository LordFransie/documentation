Before you can begin whatever, you must:

* [Sign up for an HP Cloud compute account](https://account.hpcloud.com/signup)
* Activate compute service on your account
* Create a server image  <!--need to link this eventually to the [images](/mc/compute/images/create/) page--when I create it, anyway. :) -->
