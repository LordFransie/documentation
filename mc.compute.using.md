# Using the management console: Some compute use cases

So you've fired up our [management console](https://console.hpcloud.com) (MC) and played around with it, maybe even read some of [our documentation](/mc) on it, and you're now asking yourself, "What are some of the cool things I can do with all this?"  Good question!  It's for just that reason that we've created a bunch of use cases for you to look through to help you out!

This overview page for the use cases covers the following topics:

* [What you need to get started](#UseCaseStart) with our use cases
* [List and description of available use cases](#UseCaseList), which we want to update regularly, so keep checking back
* [For further information](#ForFurtherInformation)
