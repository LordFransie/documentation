# Management console overview

HP Cloud consists of a bunch of useful services--compute, object storage, block storage, and [many others](blah)--and the entrance to those services is through the management console.  This page provides you with an overview of the console, along with pointers to other good information to get you going.

##Management console overview## {#Overview}

The main dashboard for the management console displays all your active available services by default.  If you have activated the compute and object storage services, for example, your dashboard may look something like this:

<img src="media/main-dash.png" width="580" alt="" />

Each service is in its own pane on the dashboard; compute services in the compute pane, object storage in the object storage pane, and so on. 

**Note**:  If you haven't activated a service, it is not displayed on the main default dashboad.

##Navigating the services## {#NavigatingtheService}

You can navigate to your preferred service in one of two easy ways.  First, you can simply choose your service (and availability zone) from the top-level menu bar.  For example, if you want to go to the compute dashboard, in the `Dashboard` menu select `Compute`:

You can also navigate by clicking the appropriate button in the service pane.  For example, if you want to navigate to the compute dashboard for US West for availability zone 1, in the compute pane click the `Manage` button under US West for `Availability Zone 1`:

You can navigate to any of the other services in a similar way.  To access the main object storage dashboard, in the `Dashboard` menu select `Object Storage`; to access the main relational databases as a service (DBaaS), in the `Dashboard` menu select `RDB`; and so on, for each active service.
