# HP Cloud Services version 12.12 to 13.5 migration details 

This page provides with the key details you need to perform an assisted migration--using the HP Cloud support team--from version 12.12 to 13.5 of the HP Cloud software services.  If you plan on performing the migration yourself without support services, surf over to the [migration overview](/migration-overview) page for details.

This page covers the following topics and tasks:

* [Before you begin](#BeforeYouBegin)
* [Taking an instance snapshot](#Snapshot)
* [Taking a volume snapshot](#SnapshotVolume)
* [Preparing a volume for migration](#PrepVolume)
* [Creating a new version 13.5 volume](#NewVolume)
* [Moving data to your new version 13.5 volume](#MovingData)
* [For further information](#MoreInfo)


## Before you begin ## {#BeforeYouBegin}

TBD


## Taking an instance snapshot ## {#Snapshot}

TBD


## Taking a volume snapshot ## {SnapshotVolume}

TBD

<!--Note from Damian: This may not be needed since a volume and all its dependencies (originating snapshot, volume, and any volumes booted from a snapshot) will be migrated. -->


## Preparing a volume for migration ## {PrepVolume}

TBD

<!--Note from Damian:  This should basically explain how to detach from an instance and that all assets associated with the volumes will be migrated (Snapshot, original volume if created from a snapshot, and the volume being requested.) -->


## Creating a new version 13.5 volume ## {#NewVolume}

TBD


## Moving data to your new version 13.5 volume ## {#MovingData}

TBD


## For further information ## {#MoreInfo}
