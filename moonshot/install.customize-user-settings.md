3. From the left panel, click <b>User Settings</b>.  

4. From the <b>Language</b> drop-down list, select the appropriate language. For example: English.

5.From the <b>Timezone</b> drop-down list, select the timezone. For example: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

6. In the <b>Table Page Size</b> box, enter a number. For example, 20, meaning a maximum of 20 line items will be displayed at a given time.

7. From the <b>Log Level</b> drop-down list, select an option. For example: Info.  The Log Level gives you options to either capture more detailed log files 
when you need to troubleshoot, or save disk space with less detailed log files while your system is running routinely.

## Next Step

Having completed the installation steps and created your cloud, you should now launch the Administration Dashboard to perform the initial set of 
follow-up tasks for your cloud. The steps are designed to familiarize you with the Administration Dashboard, and also verify that your deployed cloud is 
operating properly. See [Launch Administration Dashboard for Post-Deployment Tasks](/cloudos/moonshot/install/launch-admin-dashboard/).
