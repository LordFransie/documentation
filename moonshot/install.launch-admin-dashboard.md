# Launch the Administration Dashboard

After a cloud environment has been created in the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Operational Dashboard, you manage the cloud through the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration Dashboard. The Administration Dashboard provides a simplified means
of creating and managing Cloud resources and topology design documents.  The Administration Dashboard also enables you to provision a composite topology described by the topology design documents.

To access the Administration Dashboard:

1. On the Operational Dashboard, select the Cloud tab > Manage Clouds.

2. Select More > Launch for the cloud created.   

When you return to the Administration Dashboard, at http://&lt;public-IP-of-your-cloud-controller>, you will need to login. 

## Next Step

For details about the Administration Dashboard, see the [HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration Dashboard Help](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/administration-dashboard/).

While you are still in the Operational Dashboard, check the license details for your instance. 
See the next topic, [Check the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot License](/cloudos/moonshot/install/license/).
