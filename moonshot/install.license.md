# Enter or Update your License Key

The HP Helion Cloud OS for Moonshot dashboards require a common, date-based HP Helion Cloud OS for Moonshot license. When you purchase HP Helion Cloud OS for Moonshot, there are two SKUs, for a one-year or three-year license. 

If you have not already done so, you can order these in the same way you order other HP Server products (hardware or software) directly through HP or through an HP channel partner. After ordering, you will receive via email or printed letter a certificate that you will redeem at HP.com. When you go to HP.com, you will register for 
support and receive a license key. You will be directed to the HP Software Depot website, where you can download the software.

After completing the installation, follow the instructions in this topic to enter your license key in the HP Helion Cloud OS for Moonshot Operational Dashboard. 

When your license expires, you will receive an informational message to purchase a new license key.  

## Manage Your License

After you have completed the Admin node installation in the Operational Dashboard:

1. Click Settings in the top banner.

2. Click License.

3. In the licensing information, note the number of days remaining on the current license.

## Get a New License

When your license expires, follow your usual HP ordering process to purchase a new license. In the Operational Dashboard: 

1. Click Settings in the top banner.

2. Click License.

3. In the licensing information, note the Instance ID value for your cloud. The HP Support representative will need this value when your new license is generated. 

4. Now enter the license key (alphanumeric characters) given to you by the HP Support representative.
