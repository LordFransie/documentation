# Install &amp; Configure Your Cloud

Welcome! The following topics explain how to install &amp; configure your cloud with HP Cloud OS for Moonshot. 

It's important to read the topics and perform the described steps in order. While some steps are optional, 
the sequence that you'll follow in the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Operational Dashboard user interface is significant, to ensure 
a proper deployment of your cloud. 

Install and set up the Admin node:

* [Installation Overview](/cloudos/moonshot/install/overview/)
* [Before You Install: Planning Tasks](/cloudos/moonshot/install/before-you-install/)
* [Set Admin Node Prerequisites (Required)](/cloudos/moonshot/install/admin-node-prerequisites/)
* [Customize Network Connections (Optional)](/cloudos/moonshot/install/customize-network-connections/)
* [Customize Network Settings (Required)](/cloudos/moonshot/install/customize-network-settings/)
* [Complete Admin Node Installation (Required)](/cloudos/moonshot/install/complete-admin-node-installation/)

After you install and set up the Admin node, you can perform additional steps:

* [Create a Cloud](/cloudos/moonshot/install/create-cloud/) 
* [Create Compute Regions](/cloudos/moonshot/install/create-compute-regions/) 
* [Enter or Update your License Key](/cloudos/moonshot/install/license/)
* [Customize User Settings](/cloudos/moonshot/install/customize-user-settings)
* [View Updates and Extensions](/cloudos/moonshot/install/updates-and-extensions/)
* [Launch Administration Dashboard for Post-Deployment Tasks](/cloudos/moonshot/install/launch-admin-dashboard/)

<!--
Finally, if you do not intend to use the wizard-based Cloud OS installation process that's described in 
the Create a Cloud topic, and instead decide to apply and configure the install modules yourself (for **advanced** users only), 
see these topics: 

* [Advanced Cloud Setup](/cloudos/moonshot/install/advanced-cloud-setup/)
* [Install Modules Reference](/cloudos/moonshot/install/install-modules-reference/)
--> 

**Note:** Also see the Operational Dashboard and Administration Dashboard Help topics:

* [HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Operational Dashboard Help](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/operational-dashboard/)
* [HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration Dashboard Help](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/administration-dashboard/)
