# Before you Begin with Administration Dashboard Help #

Before you begin with the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration Dashboard Help, take a few minutes to understand how the help content is organized. You can find information in this suggested order:

* Conceptual introduction and prerequisites. See Welcome to the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration Dashboard.

* A Getting Started topic that provides instructions for how to begin using the dashboard. You can read about responsibilities for each user role, and follow links to step-by-step instructions for performing tasks. See [Getting Started with the Administration Dashboard](http://cloudos/moonshot/manage/admin-dashboard/getting-started/).

* A topic that lists all tasks for each role. Use this section to learn which tasks each role can and should perform in the dashboard. (This is a comprehensive list, unlike Getting Started.) See [Administration Dashboard User Roles and Tasks](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/admin-dashboard/user-roles-and-tasks/).

* A topic that provides step-by-step instructions for Cloud Tab tasks. This section is organized based on the user interface tabs and windows. See [Working with Cloud Tab](/cloud/moonshot/manage/admin-dashboard/cloud-tab-tasks/). (Moonshot document topics).

* A topic that provides step-by-step instructions for Region Tab tasks. This section is organized based on the user interface tabs and windows. See [Working with Region Tab](/cloud/moonshot/manage/admin-dashboard/region-tab-tasks).

* A topic that provides step-by-step instructions for Project Tab tasks. This section is organized based on the user interface tabs and windows. See [Working with Project Tab](/cloud/moonshot/manage/admin-dashboard/project-tab-tasks/).
 
* A topic that provides step-by-step instructions for Settings Link. This section is organized based on the user interface tabs and windows. See [Working with Settings Link](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/admin-dashboard/settings-link/).
