# Administration Dashboard Tasks by Tab

Dashboard users see the tabs that they need to perform their roles' tasks.

* [Cloud Tab Tasks](#cloud-tab-tasks)

* [Region Tab Tasks](#region-tab-tasks)

* [Project Tab Tasks](#project-tab-tasks)

* [Administration Dashboard Settings](#administration-dashboard-settings)

  
## Cloud Tab Tasks

Concepts:

The Cloud tab provides a convenient place for users who have permission to access information on a cloud-wide basis.

For example, on Cloud > Projects, you can see a list of all projects in the cloud. You can edit, create, or delete projects on the Cloud > Projects window.

**Tasks:**

* [How to See All Services](#how-to-see-all-services)

* [How to See All Domains](#how-to-see-all-domains)

* [How to Access All Projects](#how-to-access-all-projects)

* [How to Access All Users](#how-to-access-all-users)

* [How to Access All Images](#how-to-access-all-images)



### How to See All Services

The Services window provides a convenient place for users who have permission to see a read-only list of services that are registered in the cloud. To learn whether you have permission, see [Administration Dashboard Tasks by Role](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/administration-dashboard/tasks-by-role/).

To see cloud services:

<ol>

<li> Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Services</b>. The following cloud services display. <br />  <br /> 
	
<table style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top; min-width:700px;">

<tr style="background-color: #C8C8C8;">
<th> Service Name </th>
<th> Service Type </th>
<th> Description </th> 
</tr>

<tr style="background-color: white; color: black;">
<td style="min-width:100px; font-weight: bold;"> Eve </td>
<td> Provisioning</td> 
<td> A composite provisioning service that uses a topology design and profile to create VMs, volumes, and network segments as described in the topology. 
Eve uses the Graffiti service for determining resource pool existence, traits, and user identity mapping. </td> 
</tr>

<tr style="background-color: white; color: black;">
<td style="min-width:100px; font-weight: bold;"> Focus </td>
<td> Design storage </td> 
<td> Repository for topology designs and profiles that are used for provisioning. </td> 
</tr>

<tr style="background-color: white; color: black;">
<td style="min-width:100px; font-weight: bold;"> Glance </td>
<td> Image storage </td> 
<td> Repository for images used to create new VMs. </td> 
</tr>

<tr style="background-color: white; color: black;">
<td style="min-width:100px; font-weight: bold;"> Graffiti </td>
<td> Registry </td> 
<td> A searchable directory to find cloud resources based on their capabilities. <br />  <br />
An example of a cloud resource is resource pool definitions that you can use to provision to various cloud providers. </td> 
</tr>

<tr style="background-color: white; color: black;">
<td style="min-width:100px; font-weight: bold;"> Keystone </td>
<td> Identity and security </td> 
<td> Provides user authentication and tracks various projects within the regions. If Keystone is disabled, you cannot log into the Administration Dashboard. </td> 
</tr>

<tr style="background-color: white; color: black;">
<td style="min-width:100px;"> <b>Quantum</b> (new name &mdash; <b>Neutron</b>) </td>
<td> Networking </td> 
<td> Provides network management for VMs. </td>
</tr>

</table>

</li>

<li> For each service, you see the following information:

<ul>
<li> <b>Service URL</b>: This column shows the IP address where the service is running.
<li> <b>Status</b>: Whether enabled.
<li> <b>Actions</b>: If a service supports Rest APIs, you see Rest API under the Actions column.
</ul>

</li>

</ol>

#### How to Use the REST API Action

The HP Cloud OS for Moonshot API Documentation application is a tool for describing, producing, and visualizing RESTful web services. 
Its purpose is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server. The documentation of methods, 
parameters, and models are tightly integrated into the service code, allowing APIs to stay in sync.

If a service supports the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot API Documentation application, you see REST API under the <b>Actions</b> column.

Click <b>REST API</b> to start the documentation application for a service.

For information about how to use the documentation application, see the [Develop](/cloudos/moonshot/develop) topic.

### How to See All Domains

The Domains window provides a convenient place for users who have permission to see a list of domains in the cloud. (Currently, the cloud contains one domain.) To learn whether you have permission, see [Administration Dashboard Tasks by Role](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/administration-dashboard/tasks-by-role/).

To view all domains in the cloud:

1. Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Domains</b>.

  Information shown includes domain name and description.

2. Optional: To see details of a domain, click the <b>Domain Name</b>.

  Information shown includes domain name, ID, description, whether the domain is enabled, and a link to the domain.

### How to Access All Projects

**Concepts:**

The Project window provides a convenient place for users who have permission to see a list of all projects in the cloud and to work with those projects. To learn whether you have permission, see [Administration Dashboard Tasks by Role](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/administration-dashboard/tasks-by-role/).

Projects are groupings that allow designated users to view the same set of content. Projects protect topology designs and profiles, and realized 
resources (such as VMs, volumes, and others) from being visible to all users.

To see a list of all projects:

1. Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Projects</b> to open the Projects window. Projects are listed alphabetically by Name.

  Information shown includes project name and description.

2. <i>Optional</i>: To display project details, click <b>Project Name</b> to open the Overview window.

  Information shown includes project name, ID, description, whether enabled, users and roles.

**Tasks:**

* [How to Delete or Restore a Project](#how-to-delete-or-restore-a-project) 


#### How to Create a Project

When you create a project, you need only one required entry - <b>Name</b>. You can keep default settings for integrations and limits, and add users later.

To create a project:

<ol>

<li> Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Projects</b> to open the Projects window.

<li> Click <b>Create Project</b> to open the Create Project dialog box.

<li> On the <b>Project Info</b> tab, enter:

<ul>
<li> <b>Name</b>: required.
<li> <b>Description</b>: optional.
<li> <b>Enabled</b>: By default, Enabled is selected, which means project content is available to assigned users.
</ul>
</li>

<li> <i>Optional</i>: On the <b>Project Members</b> tab, add project members from the list of available users. Click the plus sign (<b>+</b>) to add a project member. Click the minus sign (<b>-</b>) to remove a member.
<br /> <br /> <p><b>Note:</b> You do not see cloud administrators under Available Users, because they are automatically added to projects.</p>
</li>

<li> <i>Optional</i>: On the <b>Integrations</b> tab, select <b>Create Default Resource Pool</b> if you need to create a resource pool for your compute regions. 
You select this option if your HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Operational Dashboard administrator used the advanced method to create compute regions. The advanced option 
does not automatically create resource pools. In most cases, you can leave the default (not selected) for Create Default Resource Pool. Operational Dashboard 
administrators usually create compute regions that automatically contain a resource pool. 
<br /> <br/> <p> <b>Note</b>: You can create a resource pool later. See <a href="#how-to-create-a-resource-pool">How to Create a Resource Pool</a>.</p>
</li>

<li> <i>Optional</i>: On the <b>Compute Limits</b> tab, select a <b>Region</b> for the project. Accept or edit the <b>Absolute Computer Limits</b>. 
This sets limits on how many system resources (such as CPU cores, floating IP, and others) project users can consume at one time in that region.

<li> <i>Optional</i>: On the <b>Storage Limits</b> tab, accept or edit the <b>Absolute Computer Limits</b>. This sets limits on how many storage resources 
(such as snapshots, volumes, and others) project users can consume at one time.

<li> Click <b>Create Project</b>. 

</ol> 
	
#### How to See a Project's Usage

To see a project's usage:

1. Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Projects</b> to open the Projects window.

3. You can select a different month to view and click <b>Submit</b>.

4. <b>Download CSV Summary</b> opens a text file in Microsoft Excel with current month usage information.


#### How to Add or Remove a Project User

Before adding a new user to a project, make sure the user is logged out. If you add users to a project while they are logged in, the 
Administration Dashboard may log them out without warning or show an error message. If so, users should sign out and sign back in. Carefully coordinate with 
users, or schedule adding users to a project when they are not logged in.

To add or remove a project user:

1. Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Projects</b> to open the Projects window.

2. Find the project, and click <b>Modify Users</b> to open the Edit Project dialog box at the Project Members tab.

3. Use the plus sign (<b>+</b>) to add Available Users. Use the minus sign (<b>-</b>) to remove Project Members.

  <b>Note</b>: You can only add or remove project users and project administrators. Higher level roles, such as cloud administrators and Arch are added 
  automatically. To see all project users, open the detail view of the project. See [How to Access All Projects](#how-to-access-all-projects).

4. Click Save.

#### How to Change a Project's Compute or Storage Limits

You can change your default compute and storage limits to more closely reflect your capacity. For example, if your compute region is hosted on a very large system, you can offer users more than the default capacity. 
If your compute region is hosted on a VM, you can restrict capacity.


To change a project's compute limits:

1. Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Projects</b> to open the Projects window.

2. Find the project where you want to change the compute limits, and click <nobr><b>More</b> > <b>Modify Compute Limits</b></nobr> to open the Edit Project dialog box.

* [How to Delete an Image](#how-to-delete-an-image)




#### How to Create an Image 

The image must be available on an HTTP URL. Compressed image binaries, such as .zip, and .tar.gz, are supported.

To create an image:

1. Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Images</b> to open the Images window.

2. Click <b>Create Image</b> to open the <b>Create an Image</b> dialog box.

3. Enter <b>Name</b> and optional <b>Description</b>.

4. Select an <b>Image Source</b>.
 * <b>Image Location</b> to enter and external URL from which to load the image.
 * <b>Image File</b> to browse to a local image.

5. Enter an Image Location that meets the following requirements:

 a. A valid and direct HTTP URL to the image binary. URLs that redirect or serve error pages will result in unusable images.
    
	**Note:** If you do not have rights to the image binary url, you receive an error when trying to create the image

 b. The image must be accessible to the Image Service.

 c. The image must be in a supported format.
 
    **Note:** If you upload an image with a format that is not supported, you will receive an Error 404, Not Found error when you attempt to create the image.

6. Select a <b>Format</b> from the menu. The image must be in one of the formats listed.

7. Enter the <b>Minimum Disk space</b> and <b>Minimum Ram</b>.

8. Select <b>Public</b> if you want the image visible to all users in the cloud. Your user role must have the appropriate permission to make an image Public.

9. Select <b>Protected</b> to mark the image as read-only. The image cannot be edited or deleted.

10. Click <b>Create Image</b>. If successful, the image displays with an Active status. If creation is not successful within a specified amount of time (set by your system administrator; typically no more than five minutes), the Status of the image in the list displays Upload Failed.

**Note:** Only AMI, RAW, and QCOW2 images are launchable.



#### How to Launch an Image

You can only launch images that are formatted as AMI, RAW, and QCOW2. Launching an image provisions it to the cloud.

To launch an image:

<ol>

<li> Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Images</b> to open the Images view. </li>

<li> Find the image to launch and then click <b>Launch</b> to open the Launch Instance dialog box. 
The dialog opens to the Details tab. Some fields are automatically populated from the image. </li>

<li> Enter or edit the <b>Details</b> tab information as needed:
<ul>
<li> <b>Instance Source</b>: Specify whether you are using an image or snapshot.  </li>
<li> <b>Image</b>: Select from the list of images that have been uploaded to the system.  </li>
<li> <b>Instance Name</b>: The name of the host you are creating (Required). 
<br /> <br /> 
<b>Note:</b> At this point, you can go ahead and launch the instance, using the defaults for the remaining options. </li>
<li> <b>Flavor</b>: Indicates the size of the node. When you select a flavor here, the <b>Flavor Details</b> table on the right changes to 
show the node properties and values associated with your size selection.  </li>
<li> <b>Instance Count</b>: Can be more than 1.  </li>
</ul> 
</li>

<li> Use the <b>Access and Security</b> tab to control access to your instance via keypairs and security groups.
<ul>
<li> <b>Keypair</b>: Keypairs are SSH security keys that are 512 bits long, provide authentication, and allow you to exchange traffic securely 
within a VM. These credentials are injected into images when they are launched. 
<br /> <br /> 
Creating a new keypair registers the public key and downloads the private key (a .pem file), allowing you to log into the VM. 
The public key gets installed on the VM; the private key is used to log in.
<br /> <br /> 
To add a keypair, either:
<ul>
<li> Select a keypair from the list, or </li>
<li> Click (<b>+</b>) to import a keypair. Enter <b>Keypair Name</b> and <b>Public Key</b> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> <b>Admin Pass</b> and <b>Confirm Admin Pass</b> </li>

<li> <b>Security Groups</b> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Use the <b>Networking</b> tab to select one or more networks. You can click the plus (<b>+</b>) symbol or drag and drop to make your selections. 
Use the minus (<b>-</b>) symbol to remove networks. </li>
    
<li> Use the <b>Volume Options</b> tab to select boot options for an instance that launches with attached storage. </li>

<li> Use the <b>Post Creation</b> tab to customize the instance by adding a script to run after launch. The <b>Customization Script</b> 
field is analogous to "User Data" in other systems. </li>

<li> Click <b>Launch</b>. If successful, the image is added to the Images list with an Active status. </li>

</ol> 

#### How to Edit an Image

You cannot modify an image format.

When you edit an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) image, you see additional fields allowing you to select a Kernel image (AKI) and a RAMdisk Image (ARI). 
An AMI image is not valid unless it is associated with an AKI and ARI.

To edit an image:

1. Click <b>Cloud</b> > <b>Images</b> to open the Images window.

2. Find the image you want to edit, and click <b>More</b> > <b>Edit</b>.

## Region Tab Tasks

**Concepts:**

The Region tab provides a convenient place for users who have permission to work with region services and content. 
To learn whether you have permission, see [Administration Dashboard Tasks by Role](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/administration-dashboard/tasks-by-role/).

A Region is a compute grouping that provides the context for the usage of compute servers, networking systems, and storage resources. 
A region makes use of a defined set of users, projects, topology templates, profiles, and services governed by a single OpenStack 
Keystone domain service. Regions are used to group different locations, different types of hardware, or to separate different resources 
belonging to different groups.

If your cloud contains more than one region, select the region to manage:

On the <b>Region</b> tab, select a <b>Current Compute Region</b>.

<p style="background-color:#f8f8f8; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px; min-width:600px; border: 1px dotted #000000;"> <b>Note:</b> Changing regions 
might switch the point of action to the Project tab. Click the <b>Region</b> tab again to display the selected region.</p>

### Resource Pools

**Concepts:**

Resource pools are used to access various cloud providers. For multiple regions, one resource pool is required for each region.

A resource pool consists of resources in a single cloud. A resource pool could represent one compute region, or it could represent a pool of resources on another cloud provider.

Resource pools help you locate compute and storage resources to use when you provision.

Depending upon how your cloud was created, your cloud might automatically contain a default resource pool.

Graffiti is the service used for resource pool registry. Every time you want to access a different cloud provider, you must define a new record in the Graffiti Resource Pool Registry. These records define how to access a certain cloud provider.

To see a list of resource pools:

<ol>
<li>On the Project tab, select a Current Project.</li>

<li>Click <b>Provisioning</b> > <b>Resource Pools</b> to open the Resource Pools window.</li>

<li>Information shown includes resource pool name, type, version, scope, user name and provider.</li>

<li><i>Optional</i>: To see resource pool details, click the <b>Resource Pool Name</b> to open a details window.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Overview</b> tab: Information shown includes resource pool name, type, scope, ID information, provider information, and more.
<li><b>Services</b> tab: Information shown includes a list of resource pool services and each service ID, name, type, model or version, flavor, and image.

2. After a short time, the Status returns to Active and the Power State returns to <b>Running</b>.



#### How to Hard Reboot an Instance

Rebooting an instance is similar to cycling power on a physical server &mdash; the operating system is restarted from scratch. Rebooting temporarily makes the 
VM and all the services it hosts unavailable. In a common use case, your installation requires a reboot because you installed new software.

To reboot an instance:

1. On the <b>Project</b> tab, select a <b>Current Project</b>.

2. Click <b>Infrastructure</b> > <b>Instances</b> to open the Instances window.

3. Find the instance you want to reboot, and click <b>More</b> > <b>Hard Reboot Instance</b>. A confirmation window opens, warning that the action cannot be undone.

#### How to Force Delete an Instance

Use the <b>Force Delete</b> option to delete an instance when it appears to be in an unresponsive state. Any user has the option to Force Delete, 
which immediately and completely deletes the instance from the project.

To force delete a project instance:

1. On the <b>Project</b> tab, select a <b>Current Project</b>.

2. Click <b>Infrastructure</b> > <b>Instances</b> to open the Instances window.

3. In the <b>Instances</b> list, select the instance you want to force delete, and select <b>More</b> > <b>Force Delete</b>. 
The instance is deleted without a warning prompt.


#### How to Terminate an Instance

When you terminate an instance, the VM is shut down and the resources associated with it are released. It is not possible to start the VM after it 
is terminated because it no longer exists. Termination is scheduled because it takes some time to free all the resources.

When an instance is terminated:

* Any changes associated with the volume that the image is running on are discarded.

* Any changes associated with the volume implied by the disk space (ephemeral) that are specified in the flavor are discarded.

* Any changes associated with attached volumes are retained in the attached volume and could be reattached to a different VM.

* The VM is removed from any security group it was associated with, and frees its floating IP addresses.

 

To terminate one or more instances:

1. On the Project tab, select a Current Project.

2. Click Infrastructure > Instances to open the Instances window.

3. Select one or more instances to terminate, and click More > Terminate Instance.

4. In the Confirm Terminate Instance dialog, verify your selection and then click Terminate Instance(s).

5. Wait for the success message.

### How to Import, Create, or Delete a Keypair

If you need a keypair, you must create or import the keypair for yourself. No other user can create or import a keypair for you.

Keypairs are ssh security keys (credentials) that are 512 bits long. A keypair consists of a public key and a private key. 
The credentials provide authentication and allow you to exchange traffic securely within a VM.

If you want a secure, provisioned cloud instance, you must use a keypair to launch images or topologies:

* The public key portion is installed on the VM.

* Users use the private key portion to ssh to the launched instance.

You can use the Administration Dashboard to create a keypair, or to import a keypair you previously created. 

#### To create a keypair

1. On the <b>Project</b> tab, select a <b>Current Project</b>.

2. Click <b>Access and Security</b> > <b>Access and Security</b> > <b>Keypairs</b> tab.

3. On the <b>Keypairs</b> tab, click <b>Create Keypair</b>.

4. Enter a <b>Keypair Name</b> &mdash; free-form text that does not include spaces, for example: <code>testonlykeypair</code>.

5. Click <b>Create Keypair</b>.

  The private key portion is downloaded to your browser system as a .pem file. You can only download the file once. It is important to save the file in a safe location.
   
  The Administration Dashboard maintains the public key portion within the cloud and injects it into launched instances.

#### To import a keypair

You might have previously created a keypair that you want to use. To import a keypair:

1. On the <b>Project</b> tab, select a <b>Current Project</b>.

### Updates and Extensions

**Concepts:**

The Updates and Extensions window provides a convenient place for users who have permission to access the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Distribution Network (CODN). 
Use the Updates and Extensions window to access catalog updates and content. Updates include software versions and security patches. 
Content includes material such as images and topology templates.

You can update and upgrade the Administration Dashboard while your system continues to run. CODN contains all the products and services 
HP offers to help maintain your cloud.

To learn whether you have permission to use CODN, see [Administration Dashboard Tasks by Role](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/administration-dashboard/tasks-by-role/).

You must configure the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration Dashboard to access an HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Distribution Network account before you can use the 
Updates and Extensions window. See the Tasks sections, below.

The Updates and Extensions window provides the standard Administration Dashboard filter capability, and you can click on the column headings 
to sort by that item.

To see updates:

1. On the <b>Project</b> tab, select a <b>Current Project</b>.

2. Click <b>Updates and Extensions</b> > <b>Updates and Extensions</b> to open the Updates and Extensions window.

3. You see information about the available updates and extensions:
