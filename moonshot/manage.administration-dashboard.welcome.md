## Why You Use the Administration Dashboard {#why-you-use-the-administration-dashboard}

You can use the Administration Dashboard as a simplified means of creating and managing HP Cloud OS for Moonshot resources, workloads,topology designs, and deployment profiles.

The Administration Dashboard also provides the ability to provision a composite topology described by the topology templates and infrastructure design 
documents. The Administration Dashboard is associated with a single cloud. 

You can use the Administration Dashboard to view, allocate, and manage all  resources within a cloud. 

## Administration Dashboard Look and Feel {#administration-dashboard-look-and-feel}

The Administration Dashboard provides customized views by role. You see only the tabs and panels you need to do your job.
