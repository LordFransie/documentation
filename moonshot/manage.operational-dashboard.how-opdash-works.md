# How the Operational Dashboard Works
The Operational Dashboard is used to complete the Cloud OS installation process after the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration Node has been booted with the ISO (see the Install section of the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Documentation web site). 

On the Operational Dashboard, you set up your cloud environment, complete the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration node installation and configuration, and create a cloud. You can then access the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration Dashboard to view, allocate, and manage all resources within the cloud.

To the left of the Menu bar are the Environment and Cloud tabs, and to the far right is a Settings link. 

**Environment Tab**

 Use this tab to review the types of cloud environments you can create, the setup requirements for each type of cloud environment. You can also set up the Admin Node to deploy a cloud environment and use the Networks view to define the networks that are used in your cloud environment. 

 This tab displays the following panels on which you set up your cloud environment and complete the HP Cloud OS for Moonshot Administration node installation. The panels are displayed in the order you must follow for the installation process. For details on each panel, see the [Environment Tab](/cloudos/moonshot/manage/operational-dashboard/environment-tab) topic.
