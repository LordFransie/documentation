# How to order and license HP Helion Cloud OS for Moonshot

There are two HP Helion Cloud OS for Moonshot SKUs, for a one-year or three-year license. If you have not already done so, you can order the license in the same 
way you order other HP Server products (hardware or software) directly through HP or through an HP channel partner.

After ordering, you will receive via email or printed letter a certificate that you will redeem at HP.com. When you go to HP.com, you will register for 
support and receive a license key. You will be directed to the HP Software Depot website, where you can download the software.

You can then download and install the software. After completing the installation, you can enter your license key in the HP Helion Cloud OS for Moonshot 
Operational Dashboard. The licensing steps are documented in [Enter or Update your License Key](/cloudos/moonshot/install/license/).  However, keep 
in mind that the installation process is comprised of sequential steps.  You'll need to start on this page: [Install & Configure Your Cloud](/cloudos/moonshot/install/).

When your license expires, you will receive an informational message to purchase a new license key.
