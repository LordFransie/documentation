# How To's with HP Cloud Networking version 13.5

<!-- Modeled after How To's with the Compute Service (https://docs.hpcloud.com/compute/using/) Some text from network guide. -->

You might need to modify the default network or create additional networks.  This page gives you some how-to's to use the [Horizon Cloud Console](#console) or [HP Cloud CLI for Windows PowerShell](#powershell) to perform the following tasks:  

- Creating and deleting networks
- Enabling and disabling networks
- Specifying an IP address for a network
- Attaching a network to the router
- Renaming a network
- Enabling or disabling a port
- Editing a sub-net
- Renaming network objects

## Before you begin ## {#Overview}

If you have not previously created an account and activated the compute service please sign up at [http://hpcloud.com](http://hpcloud.com).  

If you prefer to use the [HP Cloud CLI for Windows PowerShell](/cli/windows/2/installation/) make sure the CLI is installed and you have sufficient access permissions.

#### Assigning access permission to services #### {#access}

The user who will be working with the network must have the proper user access to the Compute and Networking services. Specifically, the user needs to have Compute Admin and Network Admin permission. 

For information on users, groups, and roles, see [Managing Account Users](https://community.hpcloud.com/article/managing-account-users).
