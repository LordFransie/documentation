# HP Helion Cloud Networking Overview #

Leveraging [OpenStack Networking](http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-networking/), HP Helion Cloud Networking is a virtual networking service that provides network connectivity and addressing for HP Helion Cloud compute devices. 

In the 13.5 release, HP Helion Public Cloud compute and networking services are separate entities, integrating services and providing new features. 

You can use the default network to deploy HP Helion Cloud compute virtual servers, or modify the default network to expand networking capabilities.

You can now define and configure your own virtual network topology, including control of IP address ranges.

To get up and running quickly with your network, see [HP Helion Cloud Networking: Quick start guide](/compute/network-quick-start).

For more detailed information on the HP Helion Public Cloud Networking Service, see [Getting Started with HP Helion Cloud Networking](/compute/network/getting-started).

## Using the console to access Networking ## {#console}

You can use the HP Helion Public Cloud console to access HP Helion Cloud Networking Service. For more information on using the HP Helion Public Cloud console, see [Getting Started with HP Helion Public Cloud Console](/hpcloudconsole).


## Using the API to access Networking ## {#API}
 
You can use a low level, raw REST API to access HP Helion Cloud compute. For more information on using the HP Helion Cloud Networking API, see [HP Helion Cloud Networking API Specifications](/api/v13/networking).
