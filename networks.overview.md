# HP Cloud Networking Overview #

Leveraging [OpenStack Networking](http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-networking/), HP Cloud Networking is a virtual networking service that provides network connectivity and addressing for HP Cloud compute devices. 

In the 13.5 release, HP Public Cloud compute and networking services are separate entities, integrating services and providing new features. 

You can use the default network to deploy HP Cloud compute virtual servers, or modify the default network to expand networking capabilities.

You can now define and configure your own virtual network topology, including control of IP address ranges.

To get up and running quickly with your network, see [HP Cloud Networking: Quick start guide](/compute/network-quick-start).

For more detailed information on the HP Public Cloud Networking Service, see [Getting Started with HP Cloud Networking](/compute/network/getting-started).
