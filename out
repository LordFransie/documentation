./compute.api.md:In addition to the OpenStack Compute API, HP Helion Public Cloud Compute also offers EC2 compatibility.  Note that the authentication mechanism for the EC2 API differs from that of the OpenStack Compute API.

Authentication specifics for the OpenStack Compute API can be found in the documents referenced above.

./glossary.md::    A coding layer that provides programming language-specific access to the underlying core code base REST API HTTP calls.  For example, instead of including a call to the REST API by using HTTP **verb** (GET), path (/flavors), format (?format=json)</font>, and the other HTTP attributes, using the request layer you can simplify the call to `list_flavors()` (the specific call depends on the details of your specific request layer syntax).  The request layer handles all HTTP request and response parsing and exception handling.  Also **request layer**.
