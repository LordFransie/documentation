# HP Public Cloud Website Overview

Welcome to the HP Public Cloud website!  We don't know about you, but whenever we go to a new site we're always thinking, "Yeah, okay; where the heck *is* everything?"  That's the question this page is designed to answer; it contains an overview of the site as a whole, as well as some details on other web pages on the site where you can get the information you need.  So ride along with us now:

##Quicklinks
Rather than force you to read this whole page to find the info you need, here are a few links that maybe can help you out quickly:

* [Site Map](/sitemap): This is a full map of all the documentation pages on the site.  Go here if your looking for information on something specific, such as Ruby Fog Bindings, the Identity Service API, and other similar topics.
* [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/knowledge-base): A collection of searchable information about HP Public Cloud. (This link is also in the navigation sidebar over on the right-hand side of every page.)
* [Forums](https://community.hpcloud.com/): Where users get together and discuss issues with each other and some members of the HP Public Cloud team. (This link is also in the navigation sidebar over on the right-hand side of every page.)
* [Console](https://console.hpcloud.com/): A link straight to the main HP Public Cloud console.  Click on it and go!
* [Downloads](/downloads): A listing of all the downloads currently available for HP Public Cloud.

<!--Add this back in at GA:
* [Release Notes](/release-notes): Overall release note information for the HP Public Cloud software. -->

##Site Navigation
You may have already noticed that the site has multiple methods for navigating; we've included these so that you can choose the method that works best for you:

* The [Site Map](/sitemap) itself, as mentioned above, contains a full map of all the documentation pages on the website.
* Next to the HP Clouds logo at the top of the page, there are three navigation pull-down menus and two quick links:
    - [**Products**](https://www.hpcloud.com/): Links to all the HP Public Cloud products ([Compute](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/cloud-compute), [Object Storage](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/object-storage), [CDN](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/CDN), [Block Storage](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/block-storage), [Relational Database](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/RDB), [Identity Service](https://www.hpcloud.com/content/hp-cloud-identity-service))
    - [**Documentation**](https://docs.hpcloud.com/): This here stuff you're currently reading; all the documentation available for the HP Cloud software ([Compute](/compute), [Object Storage](/object-storage), [CDN](/cdn), [Block Storage](/block-storage), [Identity Service](/identity), [API](/api), [CLI](/cli), [Bindings](/bindings))
    - [**Community**](https://community.hpcloud.com/):  Links to HP Public Cloud community resources ([Forum](https://community.hpcloud.com/forum), [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/knowledge-base), [System Status](https://community.hpcloud.com/status))
    - [**Blog**](http://h30529.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Scaling-the-Cloud-Blog/bg-p/cloudBlog):  A link to our blog, where you can read contributions from a number of different members of the HP Cloud team
    - [**Console**](https://console.hpcloud.com/):  A link directly to the management console, so you can quickly access the HP Public Cloud utilities
* On the right-hand side, you'll see a navigation panel that remains constant from page to page.  This panel contains links to the the places we think you'll want to access most often:  the Site Map, the Knowledge Base, and the Forums.
* Also on the right-hand side, when you are on certain pages lower in the documentation hierarchy, a second navigation bar appears to provide you with quick access different levels in that particular hierarchy.  For example, when you surf to Bindings page, you can see a secondary navigation box that contains links to Overview page, and the two subordinate bindings pages on Ruby Fog and jclouds. Whatever page you are on is highlighted, to help you keep your place in the hierarchy.

##Where to Start
"Okay", you're thinking to yourself, "That's a lot of stuff; where do I start?"  

* For beginners, we recommend the [Getting Started Guide](https://community.hpcloud.com/article/getting-started-guide/) in our [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/) to help you get started navigating the web interface, activating your services, and getting up and running with the various available services
* If you're already well versed in the cloud, feel free to just go straight to the [console](https://console.hpcloud.com/) and get going

So there you have it; a quick overview of what's available to you.  If you have any comments or questions, please get in touch with us via the forums.  Enjoy!
